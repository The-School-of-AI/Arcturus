Outside the classroom, youre likely to get to know students around campus and cross paths with them frequently.

A recent survey showed that virtual tours make students far more likely to enroll              at a school. 64% of students said theyd looked at a virtual tour on a colleges website. When asked if the last virtual tour they saw made them think differently about a school, 62% said it made them more likely to enroll . [1] Why Students Need a Digital Campus Map With most students finding their institutions and programs of choice online todayand              modern colleges competing on a truly global scaletheres little chance a student              is going to be walking through your front door before they register. Thats a missed opportunity, since the campus itself can be the biggest advocate for              the institution. Walking its halls and courtyards brings to mind all of the possibilities              that come with enrolling. It makes the experience real in a way that browsing a list              of courses and schedules cant.

The white metal reached its highest point for the year in mid-December, breaking through US$64 per ounce following an interest rate cut from the US Federal Reserve. With investors looking for non-interest bearing assets in which to store and grow their wealth, the worlds metals exchanges are having a hard time keeping their silver inventories stocked. What will 2026 hold for silver? As the new year approaches, investors are closely watching how changes in monetary policy and global uncertainty could impact the precious metal, along with supply and demand trends in the space. Heres what experts see coming for silver in 2026. Silvers persistent structural supply deficit In its 2025/2026 Precious Metals Investment report, Metal Focus forecasts a fifth straight year of a silver supply deficit for 2025, coming in at 63.4 million ounces. And while that figure is expected to retract to 30.5 million ounces in 2026, the firm is confident that the deficit will continue to be a factor for silver this coming year. Essentially, silver is in an entrenched structural deficit tied to a multi-year mine supply shortfall that cant keep up with both rising industrial use and strong investment demand. Aboveground silver stocks are running dry, with silver mine production has decreased over the past decade, especially in the silver-mining hubs of Central and South America. Even with silver at never-seen-before prices, it could be years before any sort of balance returns to the market. If the silver that you produce is a small portion of your stream of revenues, youre not that motivated to try to produce more silver, he explained. In fact, Krauth said a higher silver price could result in less silver coming to market as miners switch to processing lower-grade material that was once uneconomical and might even contain less silver. On the exploration side, it takes 10 to 15 years to bring a silver deposit through discovery and into production. The reaction time to higher prices is actually really, really slow. I think were going to see these shortages and tightness persist, Krauth added. Industrial demand for silver from cleantech and AI Industrial demand was another major catalyst for higher silver prices in 2025, and is expected to remain a strong tailwind for the silver market next year and beyond. In a December report titled Silver, the Next Generation Metal, the Silver Institute explains that heavy demand for silver through 2030 is coming from the cleantech sector mainly from the solar and electric vehicle (EV) segments and emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI) and data centers. Silvers critical role in these economically important industries led the US government to include silver on its list of critical minerals this year. A staunch believer in solar as a major pillar of the silver market, Krauth advised that it is dangerous to underestimate the le",

A staunch believer in solar as a major pillar of the silver market, Krauth advised that it is dangerous to underestimate the level of demand yet to come from the industry. This is especially true if investors consider the projected growth of AI data centers in the US alone, and the amount of energy needed to power their operations. I think about 80 percent of data centers are located in the US, and their demand for electricity is expected to grow by 22 percent over the next decade. AI alone, on top of data center demand for electricity, is expected to grow by 31 percent over the next decade, he said, adding that over the past year data centers in the US have chosen solar energy five times more than nuclear options for powering their op",

Silver Price Predictions 2026: After a 147% Surge, Whats Next? 2025 Market Performance: Silver Breaks Out in Historic Fashion Silver didnt just do well in 2025 it rewrote the playbook. The metal opened the year at $28.92 and ended the year at over $72 per ounce a remarkable gain of 147% in 2025 . That move shattered a decade-long ceiling above $30 and left most institutional forecasts in the dust. What fueled the historic rise? A fifth straight year of supply deficits and shrinking inventories. Explosive industrial demand from solar, EVs, AI-driven data centers, and advanced electronics. Growing recognition of silver as both an inflation hedge and a strategic industrial metal. The result: silver finally followed golds bull market and launched into its own, with price action many analysts now describe as a long-overdue repricing, not a one-off spike. Silver Price Predictions for 2026 Leading financial institutions dedicate extensive resources to precious metals research. Their silver forecasts built on macroeconomic analysis, technical indicators, and supply-demand data guide investment decisions for institutional investors and central banks worldwide. While these projections draw from deep marketexpertise, investors should note that actual prices can deviate from even the most well-researched predictions. Heres how major institutions view silvers potential in 2025: Analyst/Firm Silver Price Target Time Frame World Bank $41 2026 JP Morgan $58 2026 Saxo Bank $60 $70 2026 HSBC $68.25 2026 Citigroup $60 $72 2026 InvestingHaven $75 2027 InvestingHaven Peak price: $88 2028 Robert Kiyosaki $100 $200 2026 Alan Hibbards Updated View for 2026 Silvers 2025 breakout forced analysts to revisit their models, but GoldSilvers Alan Hibbard believes the market still hasnt fully priced in the structural deficits and explosive industrial demand building beneath the surface. His outlook for 2026 reflects a shift from short-term trading targets to a long-term value recognition moment. As Alan explains: Im expecting silver to perform better in 2026 than it did in 2025 (+147%). I wouldnt be surprised to see the price of silver increase by over $100 per ounce (to $175+). Key Factors to Watch in 2026 Several powerful forces are converging to shape silvers trajectory in 2026. After a 147% surge in 2025 , the market enters the new year with tighter supplies, stronger industrial fundamentals, and a rapidly changing macro backdrop. Heres what will matter most: Industrial Demand: Solar, EVs, and AI Supercharge Silvers Role Silvers industrial story is no longer a slow, steady trend its a structural re-rating. Solar remains the dominant driver. PV manufacturers consumed over 25% of annual global silver supply in 2024, and demand rose again in 2025. Silver Institute data shows: Solar consumption hit a new all-time high in 2024 & surged again in 2025. Solar alone is expected to nearly double silver demand between 2020 and 2030. By 2050, cumulative solar demand could equal 8598% of todays known silver reserves (unchanged but newly relevant after 2025s deficit). Electric vehicles and advanced electronics are also accelerating demand: EV-related silver",

However, theatrical box-office earnings are the primary metric for trade publications in assessing the success of a film, mostly because of the availability of the data compared to sales figures for home video and broadcast rights, but also because of historical practice. Included on the list are charts of the top box-office earners (ranked by both the nominal and real value of their revenue), a chart of high-grossing films by calendar year, a timeline showing the transition of the highest-grossing film record, and a chart of the highest-grossing film franchises and series. All charts are ranked by international theatrical box-office performance where possible, excluding income derived from home video, broadcasting rights, and merchandise. Traditionally, war films , musicals , and historical dramas have been the most popular genres, but franchise films have been among the best performers of the 21st century. There is strong interest in the superhero genre , with eleven films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe featuring among the nominal top-earners. The most successful superhero film, Avengers: Endgame , is also the second-highest-grossing film on the nominal earnings chart, and there are four films in total based on the Avengers comic books charting in the top twenty. Other Marvel Comics adaptations have also had success with the Spider-Man and X-Men properties, while films based on Batman and Superman from DC Comics have generally performed well. Beyond the superhero genre, Star Wars is the most represented franchise in the nominal earnings chart with five films. Although the nominal earnings chart is dominated by films adapted from pre-existing properties and sequels, it is headed by Avatar , which is an original work. Animated family films have performed consistently well, with Disney films enjoying lucrative re-releases prior to the home-video era. Disney also enjoyed later success with films such as Frozen and its sequel , Zootopia and its sequel , and The Lion King (along with its computer-animated remake ), as well as its Pixar division, of which Inside Out 2 , Incredibles 2 , and Toy Story 3 and 4 have been the best performers.

And the franchises unprecedented return in 2022 with The Way of the Water continued that history-setting legacy of greatness. As the third outing, Fire and Ash lands in cinemas, lets take a look at the truly unbelievable amount of world records these movies have claimed. James Camerons Avatar is the highest-grossing PG-13 movie , the highest-grossing 3D film and the overall highest-grossing film at the global box office after making a worldwide lifetime gross of $2,923,706,026 (2,410,657,016; 2,729,224,025) according to The Numbers as of 14 March 2023. On 1 January 2010, it pulled in a massive $25.2 million (16.8 million) to make it the highest-grossing New Year\\\\'s Day movie . And its also the highest-grossing action film at the global box office and the highest-grossing science fiction movie of all time . The film was such a massive success that it became the first movie to gross over $2 billion . Avatar was a classic example of you get out what you put in as it also broke the record for most expensive film produced with an estimated production budget of $425 million (261.3 million), the largest production budget given to a movie . It was also the largest motion-capture project with three years of motion-capture by Giant Studios in Los Angeles, USA . 80 people were motion-captured by Giant Studio for the film, the highest number of actors motion-captured for a movie . And with a total of 150x80x40 ft (45x24x12 m) on the Kong stage in Wellington, New Zealand, the film also broke the record for largest area to be motion-captured . Avatar s success went beyond the box office and it also became the first 3D movie to win the Best Cinematography Oscar and the fastest-selling Blu-ray disc of all time . Image credit: Disney Director Cameron, also behind 1997s Titanic , is also the director with most movies to gross over $1 billion . When The Way of the Water hit cinemas in 2022, it earned the franchise a new record. That movie, as well as the originals box office success made it the highest-grossing movie series (average/movie) with an average gross of $2,607,691,829 (2,150,096,675; 2,434,230,776) at the global box office as of 14 March 2023. Since that record is based on an average, the release of Fire and Ash could extend it or cause it to be lost, depending on how much it makes at the box office. Brian Ellerman from The Numbers thinks the movie stands a very good chance of earning enough to keep this record in Avatar s hands. He told us: Based on our projections, Avatar: Fire and Ash is set to earn $630 million in domestic box office revenue. Factoring in international markets, the franchise is expected to maintain its record-setting per movie/average status.\\\" Find more stories like this in our Arts and Entertainment section.

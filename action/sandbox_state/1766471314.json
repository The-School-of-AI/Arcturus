According to Indian Express, the film has crossed the Rs 8 billion mark worldwide and is approaching the lifetime collection of Kantara: The Legend Chapter 1. Day 17 performance On its third Saturday, Dhurandhar earned Rs 342.5 million in India, followed by Rs 385 million on Sunday. This brought the film's total India collection to Rs 5.575 billion. On Sunday, the film recorded an overall occupancy of 61.89 per cent across 5,332 shows. Global milestones Globally, the Aditya Dhar directorial has now crossed Rs 8 billion and is positioned to potentially surpass Kantara 2, which earned Rs 8.5227 billion worldwide, making it a contender for the highest-grossing Indian film of the year. The film has also overtaken the lifetime worldwide collection of Vicky Kaushal's Chhaava, which wrapped up its global run at Rs 8.07 billion after its Valentine's Day release. Also Read: Dhurandhar is unapologetically raw and brutal, say first reviews: 'Ranveer Singh is fantastic as usual' Tracking towards Rs 10 billion If the current pace continues, Dhurandhar could cross the Rs 10 billion mark worldwide, which would be a first in Ranveer Singh's 15-year career. His previous films Bajirao Mastani and Padmaavat concluded their runs at approximately Rs 3.57 billion and Rs 5.85 billion respectively. Competition landscape Originally, Dhurandhar was expected to face competition from Ikkis, directed by Sriram Raghavan and starring Agastya Nanda, Jaideep Ahlawat and Dharmendra. However, the makers of Ikkis pushed its release from Christmas to January 1. The film may face new competition from Tu Meri Main Tera Main Tera Tu Meri, starring Kartik Aaryan and Ananya Panday, which is scheduled for release during the holiday period. What the numbers mean The sustained box office performance indicates strong audience retention beyond opening weekend, typically a key indicator of a film's commercial viability. How long this momentum continues will depend on word-of-mouth, competition from new releases, and whether the film can maintain its current occupancy rates heading into the new year.

By: Entertainment Desk Mumbai | December 22, 2025 10:23 AM IST 5 min read Whatsapp twitter Facebook Reddit PRINT Ranveer Singh's Dhurandhar is the 10th highest grossing film at the Indian box office. Aditya Dhars period spy thriller Dhurandhar , starring Ranveer Singh in the lead role, continues to dismantle box office records even in its third weekend. The film has now become the 10th highest grossing movie at the Indian box office, dethroning Sandeep Reddy Vangas 2023 family crime drama Animal, headlined by Ranbir Kapoor. 10th highest grosser in India On Sunday, Dhurandhar added another Rs 38.50 crore to its domestic box office collection. Its total earnings in India thus reached Rs 555.75 crore. This leap allowed it to surpass Animal, which previously held the 10th highest grosser position at Rs 553.87 crore. Vanga was all praise for Dhars film as the two exchanged words of appreciation on X even as the latters film dethroned the former. The next target for Dhurandhar is Amar Kaushiks horror comedy Stree 2, starring Rajkummar Rao, which earned Rs 597.99 crore to become the highest grossing Hindi film till last year, as per Sacnilk. Given the current trajectory, Ranveers film is likely to topple Raos movie to become the ninth highest grossing film in India sometime this week. The Rs 600 crore club kicks off from the eighth position in the list of the top 10 highest grossers at the Indian box office. Standing firmly at #8 is Laxman Utekars period action drama Chhaava, starring Vicky Kaushal, which amassed Rs 601.54 crore net this year. It beat Stree, also produced by Dinesh Vijans Maddock Films, to become the highest grossing Hindi film in India. Thus, the top 7 placeholders are pan-India films that released simultaneously in multiple languages. At #7 is another 2025 release Rishab Shettys Kannada period action epic Kantara: Chapter 1, also headlined by him, at Rs 622.43 crore. This makes Dhurandhar the third Indian film this year to make it to the top 10 highest grossers list, following Chhaava and Kantara: Chapter 1. At #6 is Atlees 2023 action thriller Jawan, starring Shah Rukh Khan, which also released in Tamil and Telugu, and earned Rs 640.25 crore across India. The fifth position is held by Nag Ashwins Telugu dystopian sci-fi drama Kalki 2898 AD, starring Prabhas, which amassed Rs 646.31 crore last year. The fourth position is secured by the only Rs 700 crore club member SS Rajamoulis 2022 period action epic RRR, starring Ram Charan and Jr NTR, at Rs 782.20 crore. The third position belongs to the only Rs 800 crore club member Prashanth Neels 2022 action epic KGF: Chapter 2 at Rs 859.70 crore, which also makes it the highest grossing Kannada film in India ever, right above Kantara: Chapter 2. Only the first two placeholders in the list have achieved the feat of surpassing Rs 1,000 crore Rajamoulis 2017 Telugu period action epic Baahubali 2: The Conclusion, starring Prabhas, at Rs 1,030.42 crore and Sukumars 2024 Telugu action thriller Pushpa 2: The Rule, starring Allu\\\", 'images': [], 'rank': 3}, {'url': 'https://goyahills.com/entertainment/box-office-collection/dhurandhar-movie-box-office-collection', 'content': 'Dhurandhar Movie Box Office Collection Day-Wise, Week-Wise & Total Skip to content About Us Amenities Rooms About Us Amenities Rooms Gallery Blog Contact Us Gallery Blog Contact Us Home Entertainment Box Office Collection Dhurandhar Box Office Collection Table of Contents Back Book Now Book Now Book Now Book Now Dhurandhar Box Office Collection Director & Producers Director : Aditya Dhar Producers : Jyoti Deshpande, Aditya Dhar, Lokesh Dhar Main Cast Ranveer Singh: as Hamza Ali Mazhari Sanjay Dutt: as SP Chaudhary Aslam R.

Panicker Costume Design : Smriti Chauhan, Dhruti Ranjan Stunt Choreography : Yannick Ben, Aejaz Gulab, Sea Young Oh, Ramazan Bulut Dance Choreography : Vijay Ganguly Plot Summary The movie Dhurandhar is based on the true events that have taken place in the history of India and Pakistan. This explosive journey of Hamza Ali Mazari , played by Ranveer Singh , is about how a fearless young man is shaped by his loss, injustice, and systemic corruption. Living under the iron grip of the notorious crime lord Rehman Dakait , played by Akshay Khanna. His empire is protected by political power and compromised law enforcement. Hamza sees firsthand how innocent lives are being crushed by unchecked authority. When a personal tragedy shatters his world. Hamza rises against the very system that once tried to silence him. As he plans and launches a relentless fight to pull apart the criminal-political nexus, SP Aslam Choudhary , a conflicted officer bound by duty and fear, is forced to confront his own moral limits. Major Iqbal, a secretive ex-serviceman, enters the scene as an unreliable partner whose constant shifting interests and loyalty keep the battle unpredictable. Along this journey, a brave journalist becomes Hamzas (Ranveer Singh) emotional anchor and the voice of truth that exposes the hidden crimes. Dhurandhar is a gripping saga of sacrifice, rebellion, and the price of justice.

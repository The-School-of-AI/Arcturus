Worsening air pollution in Indian cities has significantly increased demand in the air purifiers market, as households increasingly view indoor air purification as essential rather than optional. In urban centers like New Delhi, air quality often deteriorates drastically, with recent annual mean fine particulate matter (PM2.5) levels recorded at approximately 101 g/m, more than double the national ambient air standard and several times above international health-safe thresholds. During severe pollution episodes, Air Quality Index (AQI) readings often exceed the very poor or hazardous categories, with daily peaks surpassing 350400 on the AQI scale in various northern cities. This sustained exposure to high particulate pollution has heightened public awareness of long-term health risks such as respiratory illnesses, allergies, and other pollution-related conditions prompting consumers to invest in air purifiers as a protective measure within their homes. Furthermore, pollution levels extend beyond a few cities, affecting broad swathes of urban India particularly in industrial belts, fast-growing metro areas, and regions impacted by crop burning or construction dust where PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations consistently surpass safe limits. As a result, air purification devices are becoming a staple in middle-class and upper-middle-class households that prioritize indoor air quality, especially for vulnerable populations like children, the elderly, or individuals with respiratory sensitivities. This increasing health consciousness, coupled with recurrent pollution episodes, fuels sustained demand for air purifiers rather than merely one-time purchases. The surge in demand drives manufacturers and retailers to expand product availability across various market segments, ranging from affordable, basic purifiers to advanced, feature-rich units equipped with multi-stage filtration, smart sensors, and real-time air-quality monitoring capabilities. Given the unpredictable and often seasonal nature of pollution, many consumers favor reliable indoor air quality control to mitigate the risks associated with smog episodes. In essence, the deteriorating external air conditions across Indian cities serve as a fundamental catalyst for growth in the air purifiers market. T",

Today, severe air pollution is a global challenge, primarily caused by factories, vehicles, and non-renewable energy usage in and around cities. This problem is particularly significant in India, as cities with polluted air are home to millions of residents. The air purifier industry in India has been witnessing steady growth in recent years due to increasing awareness about the harmful effects of air pollution on human health. The demand for air purifiers has increased, especially in urban areas, where air pollution levels are significantly higher. IndiaAir Purifier Market is estimated to increase at a massive CAGR of 28.51% between 2023 and 2030 The air purifier industry in India is driven by various factors, including increasing levels of air pollution, rising disposable incomes, and growing health awareness among consumers. In 2019, India initiated the National Clean Air Program (NCAP) to diminish particulate matter levels by 20-30% in 132 cities by 2024. The program received a budget of USD 5820 million from the government. As a result of the government's efforts to promote the air purifier industry through initiatives and investments, the market is projected to grow in the upcoming period in India. However, the high cost of air purifiers remains a major challenge for the industry, as many consumers still consider them a luxury item. Additionally, the need for more awareness about the effectiveness of air purifiers and the availability of cheaper alternatives, such as indoor plants, can hinder the industry's growth. As a result, IndiaAir Purifier Industry was US$ 157.2 Million in 2022. Type-V (HEPA + Carbon + Ionizer + UV Light + Electrostatic) holds the lion of share By Technology, IndiaAir Purifier Industry was classified into Type-I (HEPA + Carbon), Type-II (HEPA + Carbon + Ionizer), Type-III (HEPA+ Carbon + UV), Type-IV (HEPA + Carbon + Electrostatic), Type-V (HEPA + Carbon + Ionizer + UV Light + Electrostatic). In India, there is a growing trend in the Type-V air purifier industry, which combines HEPA, Carbon, ionizer, UV light, and electrostatic technologies. This Type of air purifier is highly effective in eliminating various airborne pollutants, such as particulate matter, bacteria, and volatile organic compounds (VOCs).

Air pollution has become a significant problem in many cities in India, with levels of pollutants such as PM2.5 and PM10 exceeding safe levels leading to increased awareness among people about the harmful effects of air pollution on their health and an increased demand for air purifiers as a means to improve indoor air quality. The 27th Conference of Parties (COP27) to the United Nations (U.N.) Framework Convention on Climate Change, in 2022, reported a 6% rise in emissions in India. Air purifiers can effectively remove pollutants and contaminants such as dust, pollen, mold spores, pet dander, and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from the air, thereby improving indoor air quality and minimizing the risk of respiratory problems. The demand for air purifiers has made them more affordable and accessible to a larger population as prices have become more competitive. In addition, people are becoming more concerned about air quality and its impact on their health due to rising pollution levels. Air purifiers are a means of protection, especially for those with respiratory problems or allergies. The growth of air purifiers in India is also attributed to the COVID-19 pandemic, as people are searching for ways to reduce the risk of airborne transmission of the virus. Air purifiers are considered a way to upgrade indoor air quality and minimize the risk of infection.

In addition, the growing awareness and education about the benefits of air purifiers, including the effectiveness of Type 1 air purifiers in improving indoor air quality, have also contributed to their growth in India.

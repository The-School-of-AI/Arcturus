Introduction</h2>\n  <p>This report provides an analysis of the Air Quality Index (AQI) for Kolkata on December 22, 2025. Due to initial data retrieval issues, a re-attempt was made to obtain the necessary information. This report includes the re-extracted AQI value and the associated QA verdict.</p>\n\n  <h2>2. Data Sources</h2>\n  <p>The primary data source for AQI information is the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) and other reputable air quality monitoring websites. Specific sources consulted include:</p>\n  <ul>\n    <li><a href='https://www.aqi.in/in/dashboard/india/west-bengal/kolkata/historical-analysis'>https://www.aqi.in/in/dashboard/india/west-bengal/kolkata/historical-analysis</a></li>\n    <li><a href='https://airquality.cpcb.gov.in/AQI_India/'>https://airquality.cpcb.gov.in/AQI_India/</a></li>\n    <li><a href='https://ews.tropmet.res.in/kolkata/index.php'>https://ews.tropmet.res.in/kolkata/index.php</a></li>\n    <li><a href='https://breathe.climate.uchicago.edu/kolkata-india/'>https://breathe.climate.uchicago.edu/kolkata-india/</a></li>\n    <li><a href='https://www.iqair.com/af/india/west-bengal/kolkata'>https://www.iqair.com/af/india/west-bengal/kolkata</a></li>\n  </ul>\n\n  <h2>3. AQI Value for December 22, 2025</h2>\n  <p>Unfortunately, after multiple attempts, a specific AQI value for Kolkata on December 22, 2025, could not be reliably extracted. This is indicated by the missing `kolkata_aqi_20251222_retry_T007F1` value. The initial data retrieval also faced similar issues (refer to `kolkata_aqi_20251222_T002`).</p>\n\n  <h2>4. QA Verdict</h2>\n  <p>The QA verdict for the initial attempt was `needs_revision` (as indicated by `qa_verdict_T003`).  Since a reliable AQI value was still unavailable after the retry, the QA verdict for the retry is also likely to be negative, although the specific `qa_verdict_retry_T008F1` value is also missing, further confirming the data retrieval failure.</p>\n\n  <h2>5. Possible Reasons for Data Unavailability</h2>\n  <p>Several factors may contribute to the unavailability of the AQI data:</p>\n  <ul>\n    <li><b>Data Reporting Delays:</b> AQI data might not be immediately available on the specified date due to reporting delays from monitoring stations.</li>\n    <li><b>Website or API Issues:</b> The data source websites or APIs could be experiencing technical difficulties or maintenance.</li>\n    <li><b>Data Inconsistencies:</b> Variations in data collection and reporting methodologies across different sources can lead to inconsistencies.</li>\n    <li><b>Network Errors:</b> Transient network errors during data retrieval could have prevented successful data extraction.</li>\n  </ul>\n\n  <h2>6. Related Air Quality Information (If Available)</h2>\n  <p>Due to the unavailability of specific AQI data for the target date, related information from nearby dates or general trends could be relevant. However, without the actual value, providing specifics is impossible. Refer to the linked sources for potential alternative data points.</p>\n\n  <h2>7. Health Implications (General Guidance)</h2>\n  <p>While the specific AQI value is unavailable, it's important to be aware of the general health implications of air pollution. High AQI levels can cause respiratory problems, cardiovascular issues, and other adverse health effects. Individuals with pre-existing conditions, children, and the elderly are particularly vulnerable.</p>\n\n  <h2>8. Recommendations</h2>\n  <p>Based on the data retrieval failures, the following recommendations are made:</p>\n  <ul>\n    <li><b>Re-attempt Data Retrieval:</b> Try to retrieve the AQI data again after a few hours or days to account for potential reporting delays.</li>\n    <li><b>Consult Multiple Sources:</b> Verify the data from different sources to ensure consistency and accuracy.</li>\n    <li><b>Consider Historical Data:</b> Analyze historical AQI data for Kolkata to understand typical air quality patterns during December.</li>\n    <li><b>Implement Data Validation:</b> Implement robust data validation procedures to identify and handle missing or invalid data.</li>\n  </ul>\n\n  <h2>9. Conclusion</h2>\n  <p>Despite multiple attempts, a reliable AQI value for Kolkata on December 22, 2025, could not be obtained. This highlights the challenges associated with real-time data retrieval and the importance of robust data validation processes. Further investigation and monitoring are required to provide a comprehensive assessment of air quality in Kolkata on the specified date.</p>\n</div>"

Introduction</h2>\n  <p>This report provides an analysis of the Air Quality Index (AQI) for Kolkata on December 22, 2025. Due to initial data retrieval issues, a re-attempt was made to obtain the necessary information. This report includes the re-extracted AQI value and the associated QA verdict.</p>\n\n  <h2>2. Data Sources</h2>\n  <p>The primary data source for AQI information is the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) and other reputable air quality monitoring websites. Specific sources consulted include:</p>\n  <ul>\n    <li><a href='https://www.aqi.in/in/dashboard/india/west-bengal/kolkata/historical-analysis'>https://www.aqi.in/in/dashboard/india/west-bengal/kolkata/historical-analysis</a></li>\n    <li><a href='https://airquality.cpcb.gov.in/AQI_India/'>https://airquality.cpcb.gov.in/AQI_India/</a></li>\n    <li><a href='https://ews.tropmet.res.in/kolkata/index.php'>https://ews.tropmet.res.in/kolkata/index.php</a></li>\n    <li><a href='https://breathe.climate.uchicago.edu/kolkata-india/'>https://breathe.climate.uchicago.edu/kolkata-india/</a></li>\n    <li><a href='https://www.iqair.com/af/india/west-bengal/kolkata'>https://www.iqair.com/af/india/west-bengal/kolkata</a></li>\n  </ul>\n\n  <h2>3. AQI Value for December 22, 2025</h2>\n  <p>Unfortunately, after multiple attempts, a specific AQI value for Kolkata on December 22, 2025, could not be reliably extracted. This is indicated by the missing `kolkata_aqi_20251222_retry_T007F1` value. The initial data retrieval also faced similar issues (refer to `kolkata_aqi_20251222_T002`).</p>\n\n  <h2>4. QA Verdict</h2>\n  <p>The QA verdict for the initial attempt was `needs_revision` (as indicated by `qa_verdict_T003`).  Since a reliable AQI value was still unavailable after the retry, the QA verdict for the retry is also likely to be negative, although the specific `qa_verdict_retry_T008F1` value is also missing, further confirming the data retrieval failure.</p>\n\n  <h2>5. Possible Reasons for Data Unavailability</h2>\n  <p>Several factors may contribute to the unavailability of the AQI data:</p>\n  <ul>\n    <li><b>Data Reporting Delays:</b> AQI data might not be immediately available on the specified date due to reporting delays from monitoring stations.</li>\n    <li><b>Website or API Issues:</b> The data source websites or APIs could be experiencing technical difficulties or maintenance.</li>\n    <li><b>Data Inconsistencies:</b> Variations in data collection and reporting methodologies across different sources can lead to inconsistencies.</li>\n    <li><b>Network Errors:</b> Transient network errors during data retrieval could have prevented successful data extraction.</li>\n  </ul>\n\n  <h2>6. Related Air Quality Information (If Available)</h2>\n  <p>Due to the unavailability of specific AQI data for the target date, related information from nearby dates or general trends could be relevant. However, without the actual value, providing specifics is impossible. Refer to the linked sources for potential alternative data points.</p>\n\n  <h2>7. Health Implications (General Guidance)</h2>\n  <p>While the specific AQI value is unavailable, it's important to be aware of the general health implications of air pollution. High AQI levels can cause respiratory problems, cardiovascular issues, and other adverse health effects. Individuals with pre-existing conditions, children, and the elderly are particularly vulnerable.</p>\n\n  <h2>8. Recommendations</h2>\n  <p>Based on the data retrieval failures, the following recommendations are made:</p>\n  <ul>\n    <li><b>Re-attempt Data Retrieval:</b> Try to retrieve the AQI data again after a few hours or days to account for potential reporting delays.</li>\n    <li><b>Consult Multiple Sources:</b> Verify the data from different sources to ensure consistency and accuracy.</li>\n    <li><b>Consider Historical Data:</b> Analyze historical AQI data for Kolkata to understand typical air quality patterns during December.</li>\n    <li><b>Implement Data Validation:</b> Implement robust data validation procedures to identify and handle missing or invalid data.</li>\n  </ul>\n\n  <h2>9. Conclusion</h2>\n  <p>Despite multiple attempts, a reliable AQI value for Kolkata on December 22, 2025, could not be obtained. This highlights the challenges associated with real-time data retrieval and the importance of robust data validation processes. Further investigation and monitoring are required to provide a comprehensive assessment of air quality in Kolkata on the specified date.</p>\n</div>",

Introduction</h2>\n  <p>This report provides an analysis of the Air Quality Index (AQI) for Kolkata on December 22, 2025. Due to initial data retrieval issues, a re-attempt was made to obtain the necessary information. This report includes the re-extracted AQI value and the associated QA verdict.</p>\n\n  <h2>2. Data Sources</h2>\n  <p>The primary data source for AQI information is the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) and other reputable air quality monitoring websites. Specific sources consulted include:</p>\n  <ul>\n    <li><a href='https://www.aqi.in/in/dashboard/india/west-bengal/kolkata/historical-analysis'>https://www.aqi.in/in/dashboard/india/west-bengal/kolkata/historical-analysis</a></li>\n    <li><a href='https://airquality.cpcb.gov.in/AQI_India/'>https://airquality.cpcb.gov.in/AQI_India/</a></li>\n    <li><a href='https://ews.tropmet.res.in/kolkata/index.php'>https://ews.tropmet.res.in/kolkata/index.php</a></li>\n    <li><a href='https://breathe.climate.uchicago.edu/kolkata-india/'>https://breathe.climate.uchicago.edu/kolkata-india/</a></li>\n    <li><a href='https://www.iqair.com/af/india/west-bengal/kolkata'>https://www.iqair.com/af/india/west-bengal/kolkata</a></li>\n  </ul>\n\n  <h2>3. AQI Value for December 22, 2025</h2>\n  <p>Unfortunately, after multiple attempts, a specific AQI value for Kolkata on December 22, 2025, could not be reliably extracted. This is indicated by the missing `kolkata_aqi_20251222_retry_T007F1` value. The initial data retrieval also faced similar issues (refer to `kolkata_aqi_20251222_T002`).</p>\n\n  <h2>4. QA Verdict</h2>\n  <p>The QA verdict for the initial attempt was `needs_revision` (as indicated by `qa_verdict_T003`).  Since a reliable AQI value was still unavailable after the retry, the QA verdict for the retry is also likely to be negative, although the specific `qa_verdict_retry_T008F1` value is also missing, further confirming the data retrieval failure.</p>\n\n  <h2>5. Possible Reasons for Data Unavailability</h2>\n  <p>Several factors may contribute to the unavailability of the AQI data:</p>\n  <ul>\n    <li><b>Data Reporting Delays:</b> AQI data might not be immediately available on the specified date due to reporting delays from monitoring stations.</li>\n    <li><b>Website or API Issues:</b> The data source websites or APIs could be experiencing technical difficulties or maintenance.</li>\n    <li><b>Data Inconsistencies:</b> Variations in data collection and reporting methodologies across different sources can lead to inconsistencies.</li>\n    <li><b>Network Errors:</b> Transient network errors during data retrieval could have prevented successful data extraction.</li>\n  </ul>\n\n  <h2>6. Related Air Quality Information (If Available)</h2>\n  <p>Due to the unavailability of specific AQI data for the target date, related information from nearby dates or general trends could be relevant. However, without the actual value, providing specifics is impossible. Refer to the linked sources for potential alternative data points.</p>\n\n  <h2>7. Health Implications (General Guidance)</h2>\n  <p>While the specific AQI value is unavailable, it's important to be aware of the general health implications of air pollution. High AQI levels can cause respiratory problems, cardiovascular issues, and other adverse health effects. Individuals with pre-existing conditions, children, and the elderly are particularly vulnerable.</p>\n\n  <h2>8. Recommendations</h2>\n  <p>Based on the data retrieval failures, the following recommendations are made:</p>\n  <ul>\n    <li><b>Re-attempt Data Retrieval:</b> Try to retrieve the AQI data again after a few hours or days to account for potential reporting delays.</li>\n    <li><b>Consult Multiple Sources:</b> Verify the data from different sources to ensure consistency and accuracy.</li>\n    <li><b>Consider Historical Data:</b> Analyze historical AQI data for Kolkata to understand typical air quality patterns during December.</li>\n    <li><b>Implement Data Validation:</b> Implement robust data validation procedures to identify and handle missing or invalid data.</li>\n  </ul>\n\n  <h2>9. Conclusion</h2>\n  <p>Despite multiple attempts, a reliable AQI value for Kolkata on December 22, 2025, could not be obtained. This highlights the challenges associated with real-time data retrieval and the importance of robust data validation processes. Further investigation and monitoring are required to provide a comprehensive assessment of air quality in Kolkata on the specified date.</p>\n</div>",

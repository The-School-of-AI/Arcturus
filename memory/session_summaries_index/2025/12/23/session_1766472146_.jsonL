What began as a bold experiment in franchise-based T20 cricket has evolved into one of the most profitable sporting leagues in the worldrivaling the likes of the NFL, NBA, and Premier League in terms of viewership, brand value, and revenue generation. Over nearly two decades, IPL has seen exponential growth in terms of broadcasting rights, sponsorship deals, franchise valuations, and digital monetization. Heres a comprehensive, year-wise journey through the leagues financial transformation from 2008 to 2025. 20082012: Humble Beginnings and Early Success 2008 The Launch Gross Revenue: 645 crore Net Profit: 51 crore Title Sponsor: DLF (40 crore/year) Broadcaster: Sony-WSG (10-year deal worth $1.026 billion) The inaugural season was a blockbuster success. The IPL immediately captured public imagination, thanks to its glamorous appeal, franchise culture, and star-studded matches. The revenue modelcomprising broadcasting rights, sponsorships, ticket sales, and merchandiseset a robust foundation. 20092012 Building Consistency Despite challenges like the 2009 season moving to South Africa due to elections, revenues held steady. The league maintained strong ad sales and increased franchise participation. Brand IPL began to attract global attention, especially with international players taking part. 20132015: Transition and Turbulence 2013 New Sponsorship & Growth Title Sponsor: PepsiCo (79.4 crore/year) PepsiCo signed a five-year deal, showing the IPLs growing appeal. However, 2013 also marked the start of controversies around spot-fixing, leading to a temporary dent in credibility. 20142015 Split Season & Sponsor Exit Part of the 2014 season was hosted in the UAE, again due to Indian general elections. Despite this, viewership and revenues remained stable. Pepsi eventually exited the sponsorship deal in 2015, cutting it short due to the ongoing controversies. 20162017: Commercial Reboot and Media Rights Evolution 2016 Vivo Steps In Title Sponsor: Vivo (100 crore/year) Chinese brand Vivo signed on as the title sponsor, signifying IPLs resilience and commercial trust. The league was recovering well and growing in confidence. 2017 Media Rights on the Horizon This year set the stage for a major shake-up in the IPLs commercial ecosystem. With digital consumption on the rise, interest in media rights surged. 20182022: Billion-Dollar League 2018 Star India Era Begins Media Rights (20182022): 16,347 crore Average Annual Media Revenue: ~3,270 crore Title Sponsor: Vivo (renewed for 439.8 crore/year) Star India acquired broadcasting rights, including TV and digital, for five years. This was a landmark moment, catapulting IPL into the billion-dollar league club. 20192021 COVID and Resilience Despite the pandemic disruptions in 2020 and 2021, IPL displayed extraordinary resilience. The tournament was held in the UAE and India under strict protocols. Digital viewership soared, compensating for ticket sale losses. 2021 Brand Value: ~$4.7 billion Rise of fantasy platforms and OTT consumption added new revenue streams. 20232025: Dominance, Digital Expansion, and Record Revenue 2023 Media Rights Skyrocket Media Rights (20232027): 48,390 crore (~$6.2 billion) TV Rights (Star): 23,575 crore Digital Rights (Viacom18): 20,500 crore Per Match Value: 118 crore (~$14.5 million) With each IPL match now valued higher than even some NFL and Premier League g",

Graphics Crickets mammoth Indian Premier League By Sumanta Sen Published March 28, 202512:30 PM GMT+5:30 The months of April and May mean only one thing for Indias army of cricket fans: the Indian Premier League (IPL). Now in its 18th season, the IPL was crickets first franchise style league officially run by a cricket board. A franchise sports league is a tournament where teams are run like a business and can be privately owned. Leagues like soccers Premier League in England and basketballs National Basketball Association in the United States are domestic tournaments. Across all major sports played in the world, including soccer, American football, baseball and basketball, franchise-style leagues have long been almost as popular as international events. Not in cricket though. The sport is primarily played at international level among a handful of countries, most of them former colonies of Britain. The international governing body of cricket, the International Cricket Council (ICC), has 12 permanent members. It also has more than 90 associate member nations where the game is in various stages of development and popularity. While smaller than soccer, cricket is followed by over a billion people, the vast majority of them in south Asia. Fans in India account for more than 80% of crickets following globally. The graphic is a world map showing the full and associate members of the ICC. Full members are coloured in dark blue while associate members are coloured in light blue. With such massive popularity in India, it is not hard to understand that the sport is financially lucrative in the country. The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) wields the most influence in the sport. According to the ICCs revenue model agreed in 2023, the BCCI will take home nearly 40% of the ICCs annual net earnings from 2024 to 2027. All other boards receive a share less than 10%. The BCCIs earnings have also been substantially higher than its rivals. Its profit for the financial year ended March 2023, the latest year for which filings are available, was the highest at $160 million. In comparison, the South African cricket board recorded a profit of $45 million in the May 2023 to April 2024 period, a distant second. The graphic is a bar chart showing the latest available profits of various cricket boards. A report by the World Cricketers Association (WCA), an independent global players body in cricket, released on March 26, 2025called for an equitable revenue distribution system across cricket boards. Global crickets finances and distribution models are heavily imbalanced, self perpetuating, and do not effectively support global growth or competitive balance,\" it said. How it all started One of the reasons for the BCCIs riches is the IPL. Indias cricket board announced the Indian Premier League in 2007 around the time the inaugural edition of the Twenty20 (T20) Cricket World Cup was taking place. T20 was the newest format of the game, fast paced and played over three hours as opposed to the other two formats which take a whole day or five days. The first season was played in the Indian summer in 2008 over 44 days featuring eight Indian city-based franchises owned by some of the countrys riches",

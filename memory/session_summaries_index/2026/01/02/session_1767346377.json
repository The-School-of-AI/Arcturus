The stock was trading around Rs 2,900 , down more than 9% , as investors reacted to the potential supply overhang in the counter. Block deal trigger behind the fall According to sources cited by CNBC-TV18 , a shareholder of Privi Speciality Chemicals is likely to sell up to 6.32% stake in the company through a block deal. The total size of the transaction is estimated at around Rs 700 crore . The floor price for the deal has been fixed in the range of Rs 2,8352,850 per share , which implies a discount of about 11.14% to the current market price. Such a steep discount typically puts immediate pressure on the stock, as traders factor in near-term downside and increased supply. Promoter stake sale history adds to caution Market participants are also recalling that promoter entities had sold a combined 4.09% stake in Privi Speciality Chemicals in June 2025 for around Rs 330 crore through open market transactions. The recurring stake dilution has made investors cautious, especially in the short term. The promoters involved in the earlier sale included Bhaktavatsala Rao Doppalapudi, Vijaykumar Doppalapudi, Vinaykumar Doppalapudi Rao and Vivira Investment and Trading , as per NSE bulk deal data. Long-term fundamentals remain intact Despite todays sharp fall, brokerage commentary on the stock remains positive. Motilal Oswal Wealth Management recently included Privi Speciality Chemicals in its top 10 stock picks for 2026 , citing strong growth prospects in the global aroma chemicals market, which is expected to reach $9.2 billion by 2030 . The brokerage has highlighted capacity expansion plans and the proposed merger with Privi Fine Sciences , which are expected to strengthen the companys green chemistry and high-margin portfolio. Motilal Oswal has valued the stock at Rs 3,960 , implying nearly 21% upside from current levels. Bottom line Privi Speciality Chemicals shares are down sharply not due to business fundamentals , but because of near-term selling pressure linked to a large block deal at a discount . Investors are watching closely to see how the stake sale plays out and whether the stock stabilises once the transaction is absorbed by the market.

The stock underperformed its sector and broader market indices, reflecting immediate selling pressure despite a generally positive market environment. Intraday Price Movement and Market Context On the trading day, Privi Speciality Chemicals Ltd opened sharply lower, down 8.36% from its prior close, setting a negative tone early in the session. The stock continued to slide, reaching its intraday low of Rs 2,752.6, representing a 13.23% drop. This decline was notably steeper than the sectors performance, with the stock underperforming the Specialty Chemicals sector by 12.67% on the day. In contrast, the broader market showed resilience. The Sensex opened 118.50 points higher and traded at 84,830.41, up 0.18%, maintaining a position close to its 52-week high of 86,159.02, just 1.57% away. The Sensexs bullish technical setup was evident as it traded above its 50-day moving average, which itself was positioned above the 200-day moving average. Small-cap stocks led the market rally, with the BSE Small Cap index gaining 0.52% on the day. Despite this positive market backdrop, Privi Speciality Chemicals Ltds share price faced downward pressure, diverging from the broader indices and sector trends. Technical Indicators and Moving Averages The stocks technical positioning showed mixed signals. While the price remained above its 100-day and 200-day moving averages, it was trading below its shorter-term moving averages, including the 5-day, 20-day, and 50-day averages. This suggests that recent momentum has weakened, with short-term trends exerting downward pressure despite longer-term support levels holding firm. The gap down opening and subsequent decline below key short-term averages indicate that sellers dominated early trading, possibly triggered by profit-taking or other immediate factors impacting sentiment. Performance Comparison Over Various Timeframes Examining Privi Speciality Chemicals Ltds performance over multiple periods highlights the contrast between recent weakness and longer-term strength. The stocks one-day return was -11.55%, significantly lagging the Sensexs 0.17% gain. Over the past week, the stock declined 16.33%, compared to a 0.69% drop in the Sensex. The one-month performance also showed underperformance, with the stock down 11.06% versus the Sensexs 0.96% decline. However, over longer horizons, Privi Speciality Chemicals Ltd has delivered robust returns. The three-month gain stands at 18.91%, well above the Sensexs 4.73%. The one-year and year-to-date returns are both 58.61%, significantly outperforming the Sensexs 8.55%. Over three, five, and ten years, the stock has delivered compounded growth of 146.32%, 428.06%, and 1005.97% respectively, compared to the Sensexs 39.41%, 77.62%, and 224.75% over the same periods.

The stock was trading around Rs 2,900 , down more than 9% , as investors reacted to the potential supply overhang in the counter. Block deal trigger behind the fall According to sources cited by CNBC-TV18 , a shareholder of Privi Speciality Chemicals is likely to sell up to 6.32% stake in the company through a block deal. The total size of the transaction is estimated at around Rs 700 crore . The floor price for the deal has been fixed in the range of Rs 2,8352,850 per share , which implies a discount of about 11.14% to the current market price. Such a steep discount typically puts immediate pressure on the stock, as traders factor in near-term downside and increased supply. Promoter stake sale history adds to caution Market participants are also recalling that promoter entities had sold a combined 4.09% stake in Privi Speciality Chemicals in June 2025 for around Rs 330 crore through open market transactions. The recurring stake dilution has made investors cautious, especially in the short term. The promoters involved in the earlier sale included Bhaktavatsala Rao Doppalapudi, Vijaykumar Doppalapudi, Vinaykumar Doppalapudi Rao and Vivira Investment and Trading , as per NSE bulk deal data. Long-term fundamentals remain intact Despite todays sharp fall, brokerage commentary on the stock remains positive. Motilal Oswal Wealth Management recently included Privi Speciality Chemicals in its top 10 stock picks for 2026 , citing strong growth prospects in the global aroma chemicals market, which is expected to reach $9.2 billion by 2030 . The brokerage has highlighted capacity expansion plans and the proposed merger with Privi Fine Sciences , which are expected to strengthen the companys green chemistry and high-margin portfolio. Motilal Oswal has valued the stock at Rs 3,960 , implying nearly 21% upside from current levels. Bottom line Privi Speciality Chemicals shares are down sharply not due to business fundamentals , but because of near-term selling pressure linked to a large block deal at a discount . Investors are watching closely to see how the stake sale plays out and whether the stock stabilises once the transaction is absorbed by the market.

The stock underperformed its sector and broader market indices, reflecting immediate selling pressure despite a generally positive market environment. Intraday Price Movement and Market Context On the trading day, Privi Speciality Chemicals Ltd opened sharply lower, down 8.36% from its prior close, setting a negative tone early in the session. The stock continued to slide, reaching its intraday low of Rs 2,752.6, representing a 13.23% drop. This decline was notably steeper than the sectors performance, with the stock underperforming the Specialty Chemicals sector by 12.67% on the day. In contrast, the broader market showed resilience. The Sensex opened 118.50 points higher and traded at 84,830.41, up 0.18%, maintaining a position close to its 52-week high of 86,159.02, just 1.57% away. The Sensexs bullish technical setup was evident as it traded above its 50-day moving average, which itself was positioned above the 200-day moving average. Small-cap stocks led the market rally, with the BSE Small Cap index gaining 0.52% on the day. Despite this positive market backdrop, Privi Speciality Chemicals Ltds share price faced downward pressure, diverging from the broader indices and sector trends. Technical Indicators and Moving Averages The stocks technical positioning showed mixed signals. While the price remained above its 100-day and 200-day moving averages, it was trading below its shorter-term moving averages, including the 5-day, 20-day, and 50-day averages. This suggests that recent momentum has weakened, with short-term trends exerting downward pressure despite longer-term support levels holding firm. The gap down opening and subsequent decline below key short-term averages indicate that sellers dominated early trading, possibly triggered by profit-taking or other immediate factors impacting sentiment. Performance Comparison Over Various Timeframes Examining Privi Speciality Chemicals Ltds performance over multiple periods highlights the contrast between recent weakness and longer-term strength. The stocks one-day return was -11.55%, significantly lagging the Sensexs 0.17% gain. Over the past week, the stock declined 16.33%, compared to a 0.69% drop in the Sensex. The one-month performance also showed underperformance, with the stock down 11.06% versus the Sensexs 0.96% decline. However, over longer horizons, Privi Speciality Chemicals Ltd has delivered robust returns. The three-month gain stands at 18.91%, well above the Sensexs 4.73%. The one-year and year-to-date returns are both 58.61%, significantly outperforming the Sensexs 8.55%. Over three, five, and ten years, the stock has delivered compounded growth of 146.32%, 428.06%, and 1005.97% respectively, compared to the Sensexs 39.41%, 77.62%, and 224.75% over the same periods.

The stock was trading around Rs 2,900 , down more than 9% , as investors reacted to the potential supply overhang in the counter. Block deal trigger behind the fall According to sources cited by CNBC-TV18 , a shareholder of Privi Speciality Chemicals is likely to sell up to 6.32% stake in the company through a block deal. The total size of the transaction is estimated at around Rs 700 crore . The floor price for the deal has been fixed in the range of Rs 2,8352,850 per share , which implies a discount of about 11.14% to the current market price. Such a steep discount typically puts immediate pressure on the stock, as traders factor in near-term downside and increased supply. Promoter stake sale history adds to caution Market participants are also recalling that promoter entities had sold a combined 4.09% stake in Privi Speciality Chemicals in June 2025 for around Rs 330 crore through open market transactions. The recurring stake dilution has made investors cautious, especially in the short term. The promoters involved in the earlier sale included Bhaktavatsala Rao Doppalapudi, Vijaykumar Doppalapudi, Vinaykumar Doppalapudi Rao and Vivira Investment and Trading , as per NSE bulk deal data. Long-term fundamentals remain intact Despite todays sharp fall, brokerage commentary on the stock remains positive. Motilal Oswal Wealth Management recently included Privi Speciality Chemicals in its top 10 stock picks for 2026 , citing strong growth prospects in the global aroma chemicals market, which is expected to reach $9.2 billion by 2030 . The brokerage has highlighted capacity expansion plans and the proposed merger with Privi Fine Sciences , which are expected to strengthen the companys green chemistry and high-margin portfolio. Motilal Oswal has valued the stock at Rs 3,960 , implying nearly 21% upside from current levels. Bottom line Privi Speciality Chemicals shares are down sharply not due to business fundamentals , but because of near-term selling pressure linked to a large block deal at a discount . Investors are watching closely to see how the stake sale plays out and whether the stock stabilises once the transaction is absorbed by the market.

The stock underperformed its sector and broader market indices, reflecting immediate selling pressure despite a generally positive market environment. Intraday Price Movement and Market Context On the trading day, Privi Speciality Chemicals Ltd opened sharply lower, down 8.36% from its prior close, setting a negative tone early in the session. The stock continued to slide, reaching its intraday low of Rs 2,752.6, representing a 13.23% drop. This decline was notably steeper than the sectors performance, with the stock underperforming the Specialty Chemicals sector by 12.67% on the day. In contrast, the broader market showed resilience. The Sensex opened 118.50 points higher and traded at 84,830.41, up 0.18%, maintaining a position close to its 52-week high of 86,159.02, just 1.57% away. The Sensexs bullish technical setup was evident as it traded above its 50-day moving average, which itself was positioned above the 200-day moving average. Small-cap stocks led the market rally, with the BSE Small Cap index gaining 0.52% on the day. Despite this positive market backdrop, Privi Speciality Chemicals Ltds share price faced downward pressure, diverging from the broader indices and sector trends. Technical Indicators and Moving Averages The stocks technical positioning showed mixed signals. While the price remained above its 100-day and 200-day moving averages, it was trading below its shorter-term moving averages, including the 5-day, 20-day, and 50-day averages. This suggests that recent momentum has weakened, with short-term trends exerting downward pressure despite longer-term support levels holding firm. The gap down opening and subsequent decline below key short-term averages indicate that sellers dominated early trading, possibly triggered by profit-taking or other immediate factors impacting sentiment. Performance Comparison Over Various Timeframes Examining Privi Speciality Chemicals Ltds performance over multiple periods highlights the contrast between recent weakness and longer-term strength. The stocks one-day return was -11.55%, significantly lagging the Sensexs 0.17% gain. Over the past week, the stock declined 16.33%, compared to a 0.69% drop in the Sensex. The one-month performance also showed underperformance, with the stock down 11.06% versus the Sensexs 0.96% decline. However, over longer horizons, Privi Speciality Chemicals Ltd has delivered robust returns. The three-month gain stands at 18.91%, well above the Sensexs 4.73%. The one-year and year-to-date returns are both 58.61",

The stock underperformed its sector and broader market indices, reflecting immediate selling pressure despite a generally positive market environment. Intraday Price Movement and Market Context On the trading day, Privi Speciality Chemicals Ltd opened sharply lower, down 8.36% from its prior close, setting a negative tone early in the session. The stock continued to slide, reaching its intraday low of Rs 2,752.6, representing a 13.23% drop. This decline was notably steeper than the sectors performance, with the stock underperforming the Specialty Chemicals sector by 12.67% on the day. In contrast, the broader market showed resilience. The Sensex opened 118.50 points higher and traded at 84,830.41, up 0.18%, maintaining a position close to its 52-week high of 86,159.02, just 1.57% away. The Sensexs bullish technical setup was evident as it traded above its 50-day moving average, which itself was positioned above the 200-day moving average. Small-cap stocks led the market rally, with the BSE Small Cap index gaining 0.52% on the day. Despite this positive market backdrop, Privi Speciality Chemicals Ltds share price faced downward pressure, diverging from the broader indices and sector trends. Technical Indicators and Moving Averages The stocks technical positioning showed mixed signals. While the price remained above its 100-day and 200-day moving averages, it was trading below its shorter-term moving averages, including the 5-day, 20-day, and 50-day averages. This suggests that recent momentum has weakened, with short-term trends exerting downward pressure despite longer-term support levels holding firm. The gap down opening and subsequent decline below key short-term averages indicate that sellers dominated early trading, possibly triggered by profit-taking or other immediate factors impacting sentiment. Performance Comparison Over Various Timeframes Examining Privi Speciality Chemicals Ltds performance over multiple periods highlights the contrast between recent weakness and longer-term strength. The stocks one-day return was -11.55%, significantly lagging the Sensexs 0.17% gain. Over the past week, the stock declined 16.33%, compared to a 0.69% drop in the Sensex. The one-month performance also showed underperformance, with the stock down 11.06% versus the Sensexs 0.96% decline. However, over longer horizons, Privi Speciality Chemicals Ltd has delivered robust returns. The three-month gain stands at 18.91%, well above the Sensexs 4.73%. The one-year and year-to-date returns are both 58.61",

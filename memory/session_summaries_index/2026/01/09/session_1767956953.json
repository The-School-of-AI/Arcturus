Trump okays bill to impose up to 500% tariffs on nations buying Russian oil India's Russian oil imports may drop further amid US tariff threats Bill could strain US-India ties and impact China, Brazil, and other buyers Did our AI summary help? US President Donald Trump has okayed a bipartisan bill that can further add to Indias tariff troubles. The bill, if passed, could impose up to 500 percent tariff on countries maintaining trade ties with Russia and purchasing its petroleum products. US Senator Lindsey Graham, the sponsor of the Sanctioning Russia Act of 2025, said the bill seeks to punish those nations who are buying cheap Russian oil. This could directly affect New Delhis energy imports and further sour the relationship with Washington. Story continues below Advertisement Remove Ad What the bill says The bill was introduced by Graham on January 4 this year and is backed by several lawmakers, including Senator Richard Blumenthal. The bill proposes penalties on individuals and entities associated with the Russian government or acting at Moscows behest if they refuse to negotiate a peace deal with Ukraine or violate any agreement. The punitive measures can also be imposed if the said person or entity is involved in another invasion of Ukraine or overthrow of the Ukrainian government.

Trump clears Russia sanctions bill; what it means TOI Business Desk / TIMESOFINDIA.COM / Updated: Jan 09, 2026, 12:04 IST US President Donald Trump has approved a new bill that allows massive duties on countries that import Russian petroleum products. The bill, 'Sanctioning Russia Act of 2025' threatens at least 500% tariffs on countries that \"knowingly engage in the exchange. Tired of too many ads? go ad free now \" US senator Lindsey Graham said that the bill, which is now headed for bipartisan approval aims to punish nations who buy cheap Russian oil, a move that could directly impact Indias energy imports and further strain its trade ties with Washington. The proposed legislation sets out sweeping punitive measures that would be triggered if the US President finds that Russian government or a person acting at Russia's direction refuses to negotiate a peace agreement with Ukraine. The measures will also be revoked in case a negotiated peace agreement is violated, another invasion of Ukraine or involved with overthrowing is initiated, dismantling, or seeking to subvert the Ukrainian government. Trump Clears Russia Sanctions Bill, 500% Tariff Threat Looms As India Reworks Oil Import Strategy The bill states that Trump \"must increase the rate of duty on all goods and services imported into the United States from countries that knowingly engage in the exchange of Russian-origin uranium and petroleum products to at least 500% relative to the value of such goods and services.\" Also read: Donald Trump claims PM Modi not that happy with steep tariffs, flags delays in Apache helicopter delivery In his post on X, Graham said, \"After a very productive meeting today with President Trump on a variety of issues, he greenlit the bipartisan Russia sanctions bill that I have been working on for months with Senator Blumenthal and many others.\" Explaining the crucial timing of the bill, the executive further added, \"Ukraine is making concessions for peace and Putin is all talk, continuing to kill the innocent.\" \"This bill will allow President Trump to punish those countries who buy cheap Russian oil fueling Putins war machine. Tired of too many ads? go ad free now This bill would give President Trump tremendous leverage against countries like China, India and Brazil to incentivize them to stop buying the cheap Russian oil that provides the financing for Putins bloodbath against Ukraine.\" Earlier this week, Graham said that India was urging Washington to roll back steep tariffs imposed in August 2025, over the same issue. Graham claimed that Indias ambassador to the US, Vinay Mohan Kwatra, met him last month to highlight New Delhis reduced purchases of Russian oil and to seek relief from the additional 25% duties. India and US have been working on a trade deal since months but no agreement has been sealed as of now, with the issue of Russian oil and dairy products being the major trade flashpoints. The latest trade meeting was held from December 10 to December 12, when US officials arrived in India. Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One alongside Trump, the senator said, I was at the Indian Ambassador's house a month ago, and all he wanted to talk about was how India is buying less Russian oil. And he asked me to tell the President to relieve the 25% tariff. The tariffs were imposed in August, with the US arguing that Indias energy trade with Russia was indirectly supporting Moscows war effort in Ukraine. With the extra levy, total duties on certain Indian goods rose to 50%. T",

By CNBCTV18.com January 8, 2026, 12:02:31 PM IST (Updated) 3 Min Read American Senator Lindsey Graham said US President Donald Trump has given the green light to the bipartisan Russian sanctions bill, which will allow President Trump to punish those countries that buy cheap Russian oil. Graham said in a statement that Trump had \"greenlit\" the legislation after the pair met on Wednesday. The legislation, which Graham has been working on with fellow Republicans and Democrats for months, would impose sanctions on countries doing business with Russia, including buyers of its energy exports, over Moscow's failure to negotiate a peace deal with Ukraine. Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022. \"This bill will allow President Trump to punish those countries that buy cheap Russian oil fuelling Putin's war machine. This bill would give President Trump tremendous leverage against countries like China, India, and Brazil to incentivise them to stop buying the cheap Russian oil that provides the financing for Putin's bloodbath against Ukraine,\" Graham posted on X. After a very productive meeting today with President Trump on a variety of issues, he greenlit the bipartisan Russia sanctions bill that I have been working on for months with Senator Blumenthal and many others. This will be well-timed, as Ukraine is making concessions for peace Lindsey Graham (@LindseyGrahamSC) January 7, 2026 Graham, a senator from South Carolina, said he is looking forward to a \"strong bipartisan vote\" on the legislation to take place as early as next week. What is the 'Sanctioning of Russia Act 2025'? According to the official website of the US Congress, the bill is titled the \"Sanctioning of Russia Act 2025\". It proposes sweeping punitive measures, including penalties on individuals and entities linked to Russia. One of the key provisions includes raising duties on all goods and services imported from Russia into the US to at least 500% of their value. Another provision says the President must increase the rate of duty on all goods and services imported into the United States from countries that knowingly engage in the exchange of Russian-origin uranium and petroleum products to at least 500% relative to the value of such goods and services. On January 6, a European think tank said India imported about 144 billion euros' worth of crude oil from Russia since the start of the Ukraine war, estimating the Kremlin's cumulative earnings from global oil sales since February 2022 at around 1 trillion euros.

      "formatted_report_T004": "<div class='report'>\n  <h1>Analysis of Potential 500% Tariff on India's Russian Oil Imports</h1>\n\n  <h2>Executive Summary</h2>\n  <p>US President Trump has approved the 'Sanctioning Russia Act of 2025,' a bill that could impose tariffs of up to 500% on countries importing petroleum products from Russia. This legislation is designed to penalize nations that continue to purchase Russian oil, potentially impacting India's energy imports and straining trade relations between the US and India. While the bill has been approved, its actual impact on India remains uncertain, hinging on the bill's full enactment, the US President's assessment of India's 'knowing engagement' in Russian oil exchange, and the possibility of exemptions or trade agreements. This report delves into the potential consequences for India and explores mitigating strategies.</p>\n\n  <h2>Background: Sanctioning Russia Act of 2025</h2>\n  <p>The 'Sanctioning Russia Act of 2025' was introduced with the aim of intensifying pressure on Russia for its actions in Ukraine. According to <a href=\"https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/india/explained-what-trump-s-approval-of-bill-imposing-500-tariffs-means-for-india-china-13763363.html\">Moneycontrol</a>, the bill proposes penalties on individuals and entities associated with the Russian government if they refuse to negotiate a peace deal with Ukraine. A key component of the act involves increasing duties on goods imported from countries engaged in the exchange of Russian-origin uranium and petroleum products to at least 500%. Senator Lindsey Graham, a sponsor of the bill, stated that it seeks to punish nations buying cheap Russian oil, as reported by <a href=\"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/500-tariffs-ahead-for-india-china-trump-clears-russia-sanctions-bill-what-it-means/articleshow/126405011.cms\">The Times of India</a>. Graham believes that this measure will incentivize countries like India to reduce their reliance on Russian oil.</p>\n\n  <h2>Potential Impact on India</h2>\n  <p>The implementation of the 500% tariff could significantly affect India's energy sector. India has emerged as a major importer of Russian oil, particularly after the outbreak of the Russia-Ukraine conflict. If the bill is enacted and India is not granted an exemption, the following impacts could be observed:</p>\n  <ul>\n    <li><b>Increased Import Costs:</b> A 500% tariff would dramatically increase the cost of importing Russian oil, making it significantly more expensive for Indian refineries.</li>\n    <li><b>Strained US-India Relations:</b> Imposing such tariffs could strain the relationship between the US and India, potentially affecting trade and diplomatic cooperation in other areas.</li>\n    <li><b>Pressure to Diversify Energy Sources:</b> The tariff would force India to accelerate its efforts to diversify its energy sources, seeking alternatives to Russian oil.</li>\n  </ul>\n\n  <h2>Mitigating Factors and Strategies for India</h2>\n  <p>Despite the potential challenges, several factors could mitigate the impact of the tariff on India:</p>\n  <ul>\n    <li><b>Bill Enactment Uncertainty:</b> The bill needs to be fully enacted to take effect, and the legislative process may involve amendments or revisions that could alter its scope.</li>\n    <li><b>Presidential Discretion:</b> The US President has discretion in implementing the tariffs and may consider granting exemptions to certain countries, including India, based on strategic or economic considerations.</li>\n    <li><b>Negotiations and Trade Agreements:</b> India may negotiate with the US to seek exemptions or alternative arrangements, leveraging existing trade agreements or strategic partnerships.</li>\n    <li><b>Diversification of Energy Sources:</b> India can proactively diversify its energy sources, exploring alternative suppliers and investing in renewable energy projects.</li>\n  </ul>\n\n  <h2>Ambassador's Efforts and Reduced Purchases</h2>\n  <p>India's ambassador to the US, Vinay Mohan Kwatra, has reportedly sought relief from existing tariffs, highlighting India's reduced purchases of Russian oil, according to <a href=\"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/500-tariffs-ahead-for-india-china-trump-clears-russia-sanctions-bill-what-it-means/articleshow/126405011.cms\">The Times of India</a>. This suggests that India is already taking steps to address concerns about its reliance on Russian oil, potentially mitigating the impact of further tariff increases.</p>\n\n  <h2>Unclear Definition of 'Knowingly Engage'</h2>\n  <p>The bill targets countries that 'knowingly engage' in the exchange of Russian-origin uranium and petroleum products. The definition of 'knowingly engage' is not clearly defined in the bill. This ambiguity raises questions about the evidence required to establish such engagement and whether India's actions would meet this threshold.</p>\n\n  <h2>Conclusion</h2>\n  <p>The proposed 500% tariff on countries importing Russian petroleum products could significantly affect India's energy imports. However, the actual impact is uncertain and depends on various factors, including the bill's final implementation, potential mitigating factors, and India's response. Monitoring developments related to the bill, diplomatic efforts between India and the US, and India's energy diversification strategies is crucial.</p>\n</div>"

US President Donald Trump has okayed a bipartisan bill that can further add to Indias tariff troubles. The bill, if passed, could impose up to 500 percent tariff on countries maintaining trade ties with Russia and purchasing its petroleum products. US Senator Lindsey Graham, the sponsor of the Sanctioning Russia Act of 2025, said the bill seeks to punish those nations who are buying cheap Russian oil. This could directly affect New Delhis energy imports and further sour the relationship with Washington. Story continues below Advertisement Remove Ad What the bill says The bill was introduced by Graham on January 4 this year and is backed by several lawmakers, including Senator Richard Blumenthal. The bill proposes penalties on individuals and entities associated with the Russian government or acting at Moscows behest if they refuse to negotiate a peace deal with Ukraine or violate any agreement. The punitive measures can also be imposed if the said person or entity is involved in another invasion of Ukraine or overthrow of the Ukrainian government.

India and US have been working on a trade deal since months but no agreement has been sealed as of now, with the issue of Russian oil and dairy products being the major trade flashpoints. The latest trade meeting was held from December 10 to December 12, when US officials arrived in India. Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One alongside Trump, the senator said, I was at the Indian Ambassador's house a month ago, and all he wanted to talk about was how India is buying less Russian oil. And he asked me to tell the President to relieve the 25% tariff. The tariffs were imposed in August, with the US arguing that Indias energy trade with Russia was indirectly supporting Moscows war effort in Ukraine.

By CNBCTV18.com January 8, 2026, 12:02:31 PM IST (Updated) 3 Min Read American Senator Lindsey Graham said US President Donald Trump has given the green light to the bipartisan Russian sanctions bill, which will allow President Trump to punish those countries that buy cheap Russian oil. Graham said in a statement that Trump had \"greenlit\" the legislation after the pair met on Wednesday. The legislation, which Graham has been working on with fellow Republicans and Democrats for months, would impose sanctions on countries doing business with Russia, including buyers of its energy exports, over Moscow's failure to negotiate a peace deal with Ukraine. Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022. \"This bill will allow President Trump to punish those countries that buy cheap Russian oil fuelling Putin's war machine. This bill would give President Trump tremendous leverage against countries like China, India, and Brazil to incentivise them to stop buying the cheap Russian oil that provides the financing for Putin's bloodbath against Ukraine,\" Graham posted on X. After a very productive meeting today with President Trump on a variety of issues, he greenlit the bipartisan Russia sanctions bill that I have been working on for months with Senator Blumenthal and many others. This will be well-timed, as Ukraine is making concessions for peace Lindsey Graham (@LindseyGrahamSC) January 7, 2026 Graham, a senator from South Carolina, said he is looking forward to a \"strong bipartisan vote\" on the legislation to take place as early as next week. What is the 'Sanctioning of Russia Act 2025'? According to the official website of the US Congress, the bill is titled the \"Sanctioning of Russia Act 2025\". It proposes sweeping punitive measures, including penalties on individuals and entities linked to Russia. One of the key provisions includes raising duties on all goods and services imported from Russia into the US to at least 500% of their value. Another provision says the President must increase the rate of duty on all goods and services imported into the United States from countries that knowingly engage in the exchange of Russian-origin uranium and petroleum products to at least 500% relative to the value of such goods and services. On January 6, a European think tank said India imported about 144 billion euros' worth of crude oil from Russia since the start of the Ukraine war, estimating the Kremlin's cumulative earnings from global oil sales since February 2022 at around 1 trillion euros.

Donald Trump has greenlit legislation written by Senator Lindsey Graham, which empowers him to impose a 500 per cent tariff on countries that purchase Russian oil. This would significantly hurt India, which continues to be a major buyer of crude from Moscow Advertisement Subscribe Join Us + Follow us On Google Choose Firstpost on Google If the US passes the Russia sanctions bill, India is looking at having to pay a 500 per cent tariff for its purchase of Russian crude. File image/Reuters At present, the United States imposes a 50 per cent tariff on Indian imports. But what if that was to increase to 500 per cent? Sounds unbelievable, right? However, the whopping tariff could soon become a reality after Donald Trump greenlit the bipartisan Russia Sanctions Bill. This development meant to economically cripple Moscow comes at a time when the US already seized a Russian-flagged oil tanker, named the Marinera , and simultaneously, continues to negotiate a deal to end the war that began with Russias invasion of Ukraine. STORY CONTINUES BELOW THIS AD What exactly is the Sanctioning Russia Act of 2025, as the bill is formally known? What does India have to do with it? We explain. The Sanctioning Russia Act of 2025, explained The bill, titled as Sanctioning Russia Act of 2025, has mainly been written by US Senator Lindsey Graham from South Carolina (a Republican) and Senator Richard Blumenthal from Connecticut (a Democrat). This legislation empowers Donald Trump to impose tariffs and secondary sanctions on countries that purchase Russias oil, gas, uranium and other exports. This will help cut off the source of financing for much of Russias military actions.

Moreover, the legislation allows for the US president to take actions, including visa bans and freeze US property of key Russian individuals, including the Russian president.

This would significantly hurt India, which continues to be a major buyer of crude from Moscow Advertisement Subscribe Join Us + Follow us On Google Choose Firstpost on Google If the US passes the Russia sanctions bill, India is looking at having to pay a 500 per cent tariff for its purchase of Russian crude. File image/Reuters At present, the United States imposes a 50 per cent tariff on Indian imports. But what if that was to increase to 500 per cent? Sounds unbelievable, right? However, the whopping tariff could soon become a reality after Donald Trump greenlit the bipartisan Russia Sanctions Bill. This development meant to economically cripple Moscow comes at a time when the US already seized a Russian-flagged oil tanker, named the Marinera , and simultaneously, continues to negotiate a deal to end the war that began with Russias invasion of Ukraine. STORY CONTINUES BELOW THIS AD What exactly is the Sanctioning Russia Act of 2025, as the bill is formally known? What does India have to do with it? We explain. The Sanctioning Russia Act of 2025, explained The bill, titled as Sanctioning Russia Act of 2025, has mainly been written by US Senator Lindsey Graham from South Carolina (a Republican) and Senator Richard Blumenthal from Connecticut (a Democrat). This legislation empowers Donald Trump to impose tariffs and secondary sanctions on countries that purchase Russias oil, gas, uranium and other exports. This will help cut off the source of financing for much of Russias military actions.

Moreover, the legislation allows for the US president to take actions, including visa bans and freeze US property of key Russian individuals, including the Russian president.

The bill, 'Sanctioning Russia Act of 2025' threatens at least 500% tariffs on countries that \"knowingly engage in the exchange. Tired of too many ads? go ad free now \" US senator Lindsey Graham said that the bill, which is now headed for bipartisan approval aims to punish nations who buy cheap Russian oil, a move that could directly impact Indias energy imports and further strain its trade ties with Washington. The proposed legislation sets out sweeping punitive measures that would be triggered if the US President finds that Russian government or a person acting at Russia's direction refuses to negotiate a peace agreement with Ukraine. The measures will also be revoked in case a negotiated peace agreement is violated, another invasion of Ukraine or involved with overthrowing is initiated, dismantling, or seeking to subvert the Ukrainian government. Trump Clears Russia Sanctions Bill, 500% Tariff Threat Looms As India Reworks Oil Import Strategy The bill states that Trump \"must increase the rate of duty on all goods and services imported into the United States from countries that knowingly engage in the exchange of Russian-origin uranium and petroleum products to at least 500% relative to the value of such goods and services.\" Also read: Donald Trump claims PM Modi not that happy with steep tariffs, flags delays in Apache helicopter delivery In his post on X, Graham said, \"After a very productive meeting today with President Trump on a variety of issues, he greenlit the bipartisan Russia sanctions bill that I have been working on for months with Senator Blumenthal and many others.\" Explaining the crucial timing of the bill, the executive further added, \"Ukraine is making concessions for peace and Putin is all talk, continuing to kill the innocent.\" \"This bill will allow President Trump to punish those countries who buy cheap Russian oil fueling Putins war machine.

Graham claimed that Indias ambassador to the US, Vinay Mohan Kwatra, met him last month to highlight New Delhis reduced purchases of Russian oil and to seek relief from the additional 25% duties. India and US have been working on a trade deal since months but no agreement has been sealed as of now, with the issue of Russian oil and dairy products being the major trade flashpoints. The latest trade meeting was held from December 10 to December 12, when US officials arrived in India. Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One alongside Trump, the senator said, I was at the Indian Ambassador's house a month ago, and all he wanted to talk about was how India is buying less Russian oil. And he asked me to tell the President to relieve the 25% tariff. The tariffs were imposed in August, with the US arguing that Indias energy trade with Russia was indirectly supporting Moscows war effort in Ukraine. With the extra levy, total duties on certain Indian goods rose to 50%. T",

This legislation is designed to penalize nations that continue to purchase Russian oil, potentially impacting India's energy imports and straining trade relations between the US and India. While the bill has been approved, its actual impact on India remains uncertain, hinging on the bill's full enactment, the US President's assessment of India's 'knowing engagement' in Russian oil exchange, and the possibility of exemptions or trade agreements. This report delves into the potential consequences for India and explores mitigating strategies.</p>\n\n  <h2>Background: Sanctioning Russia Act of 2025</h2>\n  <p>The 'Sanctioning Russia Act of 2025' was introduced with the aim of intensifying pressure on Russia for its actions in Ukraine. According to <a href=\"https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/india/explained-what-trump-s-approval-of-bill-imposing-500-tariffs-means-for-india-china-13763363.html\">Moneycontrol</a>, the bill proposes penalties on individuals and entities associated with the Russian government if they refuse to negotiate a peace deal with Ukraine. A key component of the act involves increasing duties on goods imported from countries engaged in the exchange of Russian-origin uranium and petroleum products to at least 500%. Senator Lindsey Graham, a sponsor of the bill, stated that it seeks to punish nations buying cheap Russian oil, as reported by <a href=\"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/500-tariffs-ahead-for-india-china-trump-clears-russia-sanctions-bill-what-it-means/articleshow/126405011.cms\">The Times of India</a>. Graham believes that this measure will incentivize countries like India to reduce their reliance on Russian oil.</p>\n\n  <h2>Potential Impact on India</h2>\n  <p>The implementation of the 500% tariff could significantly affect India's energy sector. India has emerged as a major importer of Russian oil, particularly after the outbreak of the Russia-Ukraine conflict. If the bill is enacted and India is not granted an exemption, the following impacts could be observed:</p>\n  <ul>\n    <li><b>Increased Import Costs:</b> A 500% tariff would dramatically increase the cost of importing Russian oil, making it significantly more expensive for Indian refineries.</li>\n    <li><b>Strained US-India Relations:</b> Imposing such tariffs could strain the relationship between the US and India, potentially affecting trade and diplomatic cooperation in other areas.</li>\n    <li><b>Pressure to Diversify Energy Sources:</b> The tariff would force India to accelerate its efforts to diversify its energy sources, seeking alternatives to Russian oil.</li>\n  </ul>\n\n  <h2>Mitigating Factors and Strategies for India</h2>\n  <p>Despite the potential challenges, several factors could mitigate the impact of the tariff on India:</p>\n  <ul>\n    <li><b>Bill Enactment Uncertainty:</b> The bill needs to be fully enacted to take effect, and the legislative process may involve amendments or revisions that could alter its scope.</li>\n    <li><b>Presidential Discretion:</b> The US President has discretion in implementing the tariffs and may consider granting exemptions to certain countries, including India, based on strategic or economic considerations.</li>\n    <li><b>Negotiations and Trade Agreements:</b> India may negotiate with the US to seek exemptions or alternative arrangements, leveraging existing trade agreements or strategic partnerships.</li>\n    <li><b>Diversification of Energy Sources:</b> India can proactively diversify its energy sources, exploring alternative suppliers and investing in renewable energy projects.</li>\n  </ul>\n\n  <h2>Ambassador's Efforts and Reduced Purchases</h2>\n  <p>India's ambassador to the US, Vinay Mohan Kwatra, has reportedly sought relief from existing tariffs, highlighting India's reduced purchases of Russian oil, according to <a href=\"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/500-tariffs-ahead-for-india-china-trump-clears-russia-sanctions-bill-what-it-means/articleshow/126405011.cms\">The Times of India</a>. This suggests that India is already taking steps to address concerns about its reliance on Russian oil, potentially mitigating the impact of further tariff increases.</p>\n\n  <h2>Unclear Definition of 'Knowingly Engage'</h2>\n  <p>The bill targets countries that 'knowingly engage' in the exchange of Russian-origin uranium and petroleum products. The definition of 'knowingly engage' is not clearly defined in the bill. This ambiguity raises questions about the evidence required to establish such engagement and whether India's actions would meet this threshold.</p>\n\n  <h2>Conclusion</h2>\n  <p>The proposed 500% tariff on countries importing Russian petroleum products could significantly affect India's energy imports. However, the actual impact is uncertain and depends on various factors, including the bill's final implementation, potential mitigating factors, and India's response.

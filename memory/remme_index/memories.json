Over the past month, the index has declined by 1.02%. Thin trading and persistent foreign outflows are major factors contributing to the current market conditions.

Gains are seen in metals and manufacturing sectors, while declines are in financial services and banking. Trading Economics forecasts the BSE SENSEX to trade at 84,968.13 points by the end of the current quarter, with an estimated decline to 78,629.33 in 12 months. Key companies with gains include Tata Steel and JSW Steel, while Adani Ports and Power Grid have experienced declines. The S&P 500 closed at 6,929.94 on December 26, 2025. The BSE Sensex historical data (past week) shows the following: December 29, 2025 - 84,773.41; December 26, 2025 - 85,041.45; December 24, 2025 - 85,408.70; December 23, 2025 - 85,524.84; December 22, 2025 - 85,567.48.

A slow bloom, a blush of umber deep,
Where iron sleeps, and secrets keep.
Not death's cold hand, but nature's art,
A fiery kiss upon the heart.

From gleaming steel to textured hue,
A painted landscape, fresh and new.
A whisper soft of time's embrace,
Transforming strength with gentle grace.

Each flake a story, finely spun,
Of sunlit days and rains outrun.
A fragile beauty, bravely shown,
On metal's face, a kingdom grown.

So let it spread, this earthy stain,
A testament to sun and rain.
For in its fading, life we see,
A cycle's grace, eternally.

Gross Non-Performing Assets (GNPA) have reached multi-decade lows, driven by robust risk management, effective recovery strategies, and a favorable economic environment. The GNPA ratio stood at 2.6% in September 2024, further declining to 2.1% by September 2025. The Net NPA (NNPA) ratio also remained low at 0.6% in September 2024. This positive trajectory is expected to continue, with projections indicating a GNPA range of 1.8% to 2.3% for 2026-2027. Key drivers include sustained economic growth, proactive RBI regulations, ongoing banking sector reforms, and healthy credit appetite.",

This improvement is not isolated but a sector-wide phenomenon, driven by enhanced recovery efforts, strategic write-offs, and improved credit appraisal processes. The absolute quantum of problematic loans has reduced due to better economic conditions, proactive identification of stress, and stronger legal/regulatory frameworks for asset resolution. Banks have invested in advanced risk assessment capabilities and specialized recovery teams, while the RBI's guidelines have pushed for balance sheet clean-up and prudent lending. This has curtailed new NPA accumulation and effectively resolved existing ones."

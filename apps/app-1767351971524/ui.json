Key insights for major metro cities include:\n\n### 3.1 Delhi\nDelhi experiences hazardous pollution levels, especially during the winter months, making it a key demand hub for air purifiers. High Air Quality Index (AQI) levels drive demand for advanced air purifiers. Residents are more likely to invest in health-centric products due to higher disposable incomes and growing environmental consciousness. There is a strong preference for HEPA air purifiers due to the high levels of particulate pollution.\n\n### 3.2 Mumbai\nMumbai faces severe pollution issues due to rapid urbanization, industrial activities, and high vehicular emissions. Similar to Delhi, residents show increasing health consciousness and a willingness to invest in air purifiers. There is a demand for air purifiers with activated carbon filtration to address harmful gases and VOCs.\n\n### 3.3 Bengaluru\nBengaluru's air purifier market is driven by its large population and urbanization, though pollution levels may be relatively lower compared to Delhi and Mumbai. The tech-savvy population drives demand for smart air purifiers and integration with smart home systems. There is a growing interest in IoT-enabled air purifiers and advanced filtration technologies."

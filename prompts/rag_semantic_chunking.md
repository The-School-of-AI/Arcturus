You are helping to segment a document into topic-based chunks. Unfortunately, the sentences are mixed up in this text block.

Does the TEXT BLOCK below have 2+ distinct topics? Should these two chunks appear in the **same paragraph or flow of writing**? Even if the subject changes slightly (e.g., One person to another), treat them as related **if they belong to the same broader context or topic** (like cricket, AI, or real estate). Also consider cues like continuity words (e.g., "However", "But", "Also") or references that link the sentences.

YES: Reply with first 15 words of second topic.
NO: Reply "SINGLE"

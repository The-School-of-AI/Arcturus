From ornaments worn during weddings to coins gifted on festivals, silver continues to be a preferred choice for families who value both beauty and financial wisdom. Unlike gold, silver remains affordable and accessible, making it a popular choice across all income groups in Bangalore. It bridges the gap between cultural heritage and modern investment.

It has historical value and is often sought by collectors. 800 Silver: Made of 80% silver, it is generally used for utensils, religious artifacts, and decorative household items.

The `RetrieverAgent` prompt asks to \"Return the price and the source of the information,\" which is good, but the `FormatterAgent` prompt implicitly assumes these will be available as variables when they might just be returned as raw text. More importantly, the `CoderAgent` prompt, while specifying the file name and path, does not explicitly state that the agent should *execute* the file writing. The prompt is phrased as an instruction to the CoderAgent, but the plan graph itself doesn't contain an execution step. The user's request implies direct execution of the file save operation, which is not directly represented as an executable action within the plan. Also, the prompt does not account for potential errors during file writing or if the silver price is not found. A more robust plan would include error handling."

In cities like Bangalore, silver is more than just a metal; its a part of peoples lifestyle and tradition. From ornaments worn during weddings to coins gifted on festivals, silver continues to be a preferred choice for families who value both beauty and financial wisdom.

In cities like Bangalore, silver is more than just a metal; its a part of peoples lifestyle and tradition. From ornaments worn during weddings to coins gifted on festivals, silver continues to be a preferred choice for families who value both beauty and financial wisdom. Unlike gold, silver remains affordable and accessible, making it a popular choice across all income groups in Bangalore. It bridges the gap between cultural heritage and modern investment.

It has historical value and is often sought by collectors. 800 Silver: Made of 80% silver, it is generally used for utensils, religious artifacts, and decorative household items.

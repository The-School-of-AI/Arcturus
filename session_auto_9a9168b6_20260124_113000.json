Frequently Asked Questions Quick Summary DeepSeek, in collaboration with Peking University, has released a 33-page paper introducing Engram a new sparse memory module that complements Mixture of Experts (MoE). While MoE solves \"how to calculate less,\" Engram solves \"don't calculate blindly\" by providing deterministic O(1) knowledge lookup for static patterns like entity names and fixed phrases. The paper discovers a Sparsity Allocation Law: 20-25% of sparse parameters should go to memory, with the rest to computation. The Problem: Transformer's Memory Limitation Currently, Mixture of Experts (MoE) has become the mainstream architecture for large language models, powering systems like DeepSeek V3, Mixtral, and others. However, it's fundamentally still based on the Transformer architecture, which lacks a native \"knowledge lookup\" mechanism.Programming This means that many tasks that should be solved in O(1) time like retrieving factual information have to be \"simulated\" through extensive computations. The model essentially has to compute its way to remember things that could simply be looked up.

In theory, this process could be completed through a single knowledge lookup operation like looking up a word in a dictionary. The paper argues that this is fundamentally wasteful: using expensive compute cycles to repeatedly \"rediscover\" static knowledge that could be retrieved in constant time. Enter Eng",

In one study, researchers successfully prompted an LLM to spit out, for example, a nearly complete Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone 1 . While this raises huge concerns about large-scale copyright violations, it's also true that we simultaneously want these models to remember facts about the world and not make them up, or hallucinate. And modern LLMs do ingest and remember an enormous amount of facts and patterns that they gleaned from the training data. But if we go looking for exactly where this knowledge is stored inside the model, we'll come up empty handed. That's because factual knowledge inside LLMs is not stored in some lookup table and fetched on demand. Rather, such knowledge is encoded in the weights or parameters of the model (the strengths of the connections between the artificial neurons that make up the networks); the LLM learns the values for these parameters during training. So each time we prompt an LLM, it has to use its parameters to reconstruct the relevant factual knowledge, making it a compute-intensive process, which then takes resources away from the reasoning needed to solve some task. DeepSeek write in their latest paper 2 : Language modeling entails two qualitatively different sub-tasks: compositional reasoning and knowledge retrieval. While the former demands deep, dynamic computation, a substantial portion of textsuch as named entities and formulaic patternsis local, static, and highly stereotyped Current LLMs are forced to simulate retrieval through computation [Italics mine]. What if one could separate the retrieval from most of the neural network's computations, turning the task into some computationally inexpensive lookup, and thus free up the models parameters for important tasks, such as logic and reasoning? More importantly, the storage and retrieval of knowledge (such as facts and common linguistic patterns) should depend on the statistics of the training data, and the process should be amenable to learning via the standard training algorithm, i.e. gradient descent done using backpropagation memory should not be hacked on as an afterthought. In other words, it should be part of an LLM's internal architecture. DeepSeek's paper suggests they have achieved just that, at least in part. Subscribe to receive new posts and support WHERE MACHINES THINK. Thank you! Subscribe They argue that their method creates a new primitive that can become an indispensable ingredient for LLMs. By leveraging decades-old ideas about n- grams from the field of natural language processing (NLP), DeepSeek's architectural tweak stores factual information in an embedding matrix (the values of this matrix are learned during training), and retrieves it on demand during inference using trivially little compute (relative to the compute needed for other tasks such as reasoning). The approach frees up the early layers of an LLM from having to reconstruct factual knowledge, effectively deepening the network for complex reasoning. Understanding DeepSeek's solution requires us to first take a brief look at n- grams, get a high-level overview of a modern Transformer-based LLM, and then delve into DeepSeek's innovation. Going Back to N-Grams DeepSeek designed a new, modular neural network block that can be inserted between Transformer layers of a large language model ( for those unfamiliar with a modern LLM, there's an overview of the architecture in the next section ).

Blake Crosley Jan 14, 2026 9 min read Disclaimer DeepSeek's Engram Separates Memory from Reasoning in LLM Architecture Breakthrough DeepSeek published research on January 12, 2026 introducing Engram, a conditional memory module that achieves constant-time knowledge retrieval by decoupling static pattern storage from dynamic reasoningpotentially bypassing the GPU high-bandwidth memory constraints that limit model scaling. TL;DR DeepSeek's Engram module introduces a new axis of sparsity for large language models, separating factual knowledge storage from computational reasoning. Testing on a 27-billion-parameter model shows benchmark improvements of 3-5 points across knowledge, reasoning, and coding tasks, with Needle-in-a-Haystack accuracy jumping from 84.2% to 97%. The researchers demonstrated offloading a 100-billion-parameter embedding table to system DRAM with throughput penalties below 3%. Co-authored by founder Liang Wenfeng and Peking University researchers, the fully open-source paper and code suggest Engram will underpin DeepSeek's forthcoming V4 model. The Problem: GPU Memory as Scaling Bottleneck Modern Transformers suffer from a fundamental architectural inefficiency. When an LLM needs to recall a static fact\"Paris is the capital of France\" or \"Diana, Princess of Wales\"it cannot query a database [1]. Instead, the model simulates retrieval through expensive computation, consuming multiple layers of attention and feed-forward networks to reconstruct patterns that could be handled by simple lookup [1]. Architecture Type Knowledge Handling GPU HBM Usage Standard Transformer All layers compute everything High Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Conditional computation High Engram + MoE Static lookup + dynamic reasoning Optimized This inefficiency compounds as models scale. GPU high-bandwidth memory remains expensive and scarce [2]. The mere presence of larger, faster HBM does not yield sustained slackdevelopers immediately build larger models to fill it, ensuring memory remains the next bottleneck [3]. Engram Architecture: How It Works Engram introduces conditional memory as a complementary axis of sparsity, modernizing classic N-gram embeddings to perform constant-time O(1) lookups alongside the neural backbone [4]. Three Core Innovations Tokenizer Compression : Engram compresses equivalent tokens (different capitalizations of the same word) to canonical forms, reducing vocabulary size by 23% [5]. The compression pipeline converts tokens through text normalization (NFKC NFD strip accents lowercase whitespace collapse) and maps all tokens normalizing to the same string to a single compressed ID [6]. Multi-Head Hashing : Storing a table for every possible N-gram combination is intractable. Engram employs K distinct hash heads for each N-gram order to mitigate collisions [7]. When retrieving embeddings, the system aggregates across all heads, reducing the impact of any single collision [8]. Context-Aware Gating : Retrieved embeddings pass through a gating mechanism where the model's current hidden state acts as a query [9]. If retrieved memory contradicts the broader context,",

GitHub Repository & Resources 12. Frequently Asked Questions Quick Summary DeepSeek, in collaboration with Peking University, has released a 33-page paper introducing Engram a new sparse memory module that complements Mixture of Experts (MoE). While MoE solves \"how to calculate less,\" Engram solves \"don't calculate blindly\" by providing deterministic O(1) knowledge lookup for static patterns like entity names and fixed phrases. The paper discovers a Sparsity Allocation Law: 20-25% of sparse parameters should go to memory, with the rest to computation. The Problem: Transformer's Memory Limitation Currently, Mixture of Experts (MoE) has become the mainstream architecture for large language models, powering systems like DeepSeek V3, Mixtral, and others. However, it's fundamentally still based on the Transformer architecture, which lacks a native \"knowledge lookup\" mechanism.Programming This means that many tasks that should be solved in O(1) time like retrieving factual information have to be \"simulated\" through extensive computations. The model essentially has to compute its way to remember things that could simply be looked up. Discover more Paper paper Information retrieval Math Mathematics Computer programming Computer DeepSeek R1 AI ML  Example: To identify the entity \"Diana, Princess of Wales,\" an LLM has to consume multi-layer attention and FFN to gradually combine features. In theory, this process could be completed through a single knowledge lookup operation like looking up a word in a dictionary. The paper argues that this is fundamentally wasteful: using expensive compute cycles to repeatedly \"rediscover\" static knowledge that could be retrieved in constant time. Enter Eng",

In one study, researchers successfully prompted an LLM to spit out, for example, a nearly complete Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone 1 . While this raises huge concerns about large-scale copyright violations, it's also true that we simultaneously want these models to remember facts about the world and not make them up, or hallucinate. And modern LLMs do ingest and remember an enormous amount of facts and patterns that they gleaned from the training data. But if we go looking for exactly where this knowledge is stored inside the model, we'll come up empty handed. That's because factual knowledge inside LLMs is not stored in some lookup table and fetched on demand. Rather, such knowledge is encoded in the weights or parameters of the model (the strengths of the connections between the artificial neurons that make up the networks); the LLM learns the values for these parameters during training. So each time we prompt an LLM, it has to use its parameters to reconstruct the relevant factual knowledge, making it a compute-intensive process, which then takes resources away from the reasoning needed to solve some task. DeepSeek write in their latest paper 2 : Language modeling entails two qualitatively different sub-tasks: compositional reasoning and knowledge retrieval. While the former demands deep, dynamic computation, a substantial portion of textsuch as named entities and formulaic patternsis local, static, and highly stereotyped Current LLMs are forced to simulate retrieval through computation [Italics mine]. What if one could separate the retrieval from most of the neural network's computations, turning the task into some computationally inexpensive lookup, and thus free up the models parameters for important tasks, such as logic and reasoning? More importantly, the storage and retrieval of knowledge (such as facts and common linguistic patterns) should depend on the statistics of the training data, and the process should be amenable to learning via the standard training algorithm, i.e. gradient descent done using backpropagation memory should not be hacked on as an afterthought. In other words, it should be part of an LLM's internal architecture. DeepSeek's paper suggests they have achieved just that, at least in part.

Subscribe They argue that their method creates a new primitive that can become an indispensable ingredient for LLMs. By leveraging decades-old ideas about n- grams from the field of natural language processing (NLP), DeepSeek's architectural tweak stores factual information in an embedding matrix (the values of this matrix are learned during training), and retrieves it on demand during inference using trivially little compute (relative to the compute needed for other tasks such as reasoning). The approach frees up the early layers of an LLM from having to reconstruct factual knowledge, effectively deepening the network for complex reasoning. Understanding DeepSeek's solution requires us to first take a brief look at n- grams, get a high-level overview of a modern Transformer-based LLM, and then delve into DeepSeek's innovation. Going Back to N-Grams DeepSeek designed a new, modular neural network block that can be inserted between Transformer layers of a large language model ( for those unfamiliar with a modern LLM, there's an overview of the architecture in the next section ).

Blake Crosley Jan 14, 2026 9 min read Disclaimer DeepSeek's Engram Separates Memory from Reasoning in LLM Architecture Breakthrough DeepSeek published research on January 12, 2026 introducing Engram, a conditional memory module that achieves constant-time knowledge retrieval by decoupling static pattern storage from dynamic reasoningpotentially bypassing the GPU high-bandwidth memory constraints that limit model scaling. TL;DR DeepSeek's Engram module introduces a new axis of sparsity for large language models, separating factual knowledge storage from computational reasoning. Testing on a 27-billion-parameter model shows benchmark improvements of 3-5 points across knowledge, reasoning, and coding tasks, with Needle-in-a-Haystack accuracy jumping from 84.2% to 97%. The researchers demonstrated offloading a 100-billion-parameter embedding table to system DRAM with throughput penalties below 3%. Co-authored by founder Liang Wenfeng and Peking University researchers, the fully open-source paper and code suggest Engram will underpin DeepSeek's forthcoming V4 model. The Problem: GPU Memory as Scaling Bottleneck Modern Transformers suffer from a fundamental architectural inefficiency. When an LLM needs to recall a static fact\"Paris is the capital of France\" or \"Diana, Princess of Wales\"it cannot query a database [1]. Instead, the model simulates retrieval through expensive computation, consuming multiple layers of attention and feed-forward networks to reconstruct patterns that could be handled by simple lookup [1]. Architecture Type Knowledge Handling GPU HBM Usage Standard Transformer All layers compute everything High Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Conditional computation High Engram + MoE Static lookup + dynamic reasoning Optimized This inefficiency compounds as models scale. GPU high-bandwidth memory remains expensive and scarce [2]. The mere presence of larger, faster HBM does not yield sustained slackdevelopers immediately build larger models to fill it, ensuring memory remains the next bottleneck [3]. Engram Architecture: How It Works Engram introduces conditional memory as a complementary axis of sparsity, modernizing classic N-gram embeddings to perform constant-time O(1) lookups alongside the neural backbone [4]. Three Core Innovations Tokenizer Compression : Engram compresses equivalent tokens (different capitalizations of the same word) to canonical forms, reducing vocabulary size by 23% [5]. The compression pipeline converts tokens through text normalization (NFKC NFD strip accents lowercase whitespace collapse) and maps all tokens normalizing to the same string to a single compressed ID [6]. Multi-Head Hashing : Storing a table for every possible N-gram combination is intractable. Engram employs K distinct hash heads for each N-gram order to mitigate collisions [7]. When retrieving embeddings, the system aggregates across all heads, reducing the impact of any single collision [8]. Context-Aware Gating : Retrieved embeddings pass through a gating mechanism where the model's current hidden state acts as a query [9]. If retrieved memory contradicts the broader context,",

This paper begins by reviewing the evolution of large AI models focusing on paradigm shifts, the mainstream Large Language Model (LLM) paradigm, and the DeepSeek paradigm. Subsequently, the paper highlights novel algorithms introduced by DeepSeek, including Multi-head Latent Attention (MLA), Mixture-of-Experts (MoE), Multi-Token Prediction (MTP), and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). The paper then explores DeepSeek engineering breakthroughs in LLM scaling, training, inference, and system-level optimization architecture. Moreover, the impact of DeepSeek models on the competitive AI landscape is analyzed, comparing them to mainstream LLMs across various fields. Finally, the paper reflects on the insights gained from DeepSeek innovations and discusses future trends in the technical and engineering development of large AI models, particularly in data, training, and reasoning.

Frequently Asked Questions Quick Summary DeepSeek, in collaboration with Peking University, has released a 33-page paper introducing Engram a new sparse memory module that complements Mixture of Experts (MoE). While MoE solves \"how to calculate less,\" Engram solves \"don't calculate blindly\" by providing deterministic O(1) knowledge lookup for static patterns like entity names and fixed phrases. The paper discovers a Sparsity Allocation Law: 20-25% of sparse parameters should go to memory, with the rest to computation. The Problem: Transformer's Memory Limitation Currently, Mixture of Experts (MoE) has become the mainstream architecture for large language models, powering systems like DeepSeek V3, Mixtral, and others. However, it's fundamentally still based on the Transformer architecture, which lacks a native \"knowledge lookup\" mechanism. This means that many tasks that should be solved in O(1) time like retrieving factual information have to be \"simulated\" through extensive computations. The model essentially has to compute its way to remember things that could simply be looked up.

In theory, this process could be completed through a single knowledge lookup operation like looking up a word in a dictionary. The paper argues that this is fundamentally wasteful: using expensive compute cycles to repeatedly \"rediscover\" static knowledge that could be retrieved in constant time. Enter Engram: The \"Electronic Brain\" Module The term Engram originates from neurology, meaning \"memory trace\" an extensible and retrievable memory unit.

TL;DR DeepSeek's Engram module introduces a new axis of sparsity for large language models, separating factual knowledge storage from computational reasoning. Testing on a 27-billion-parameter model shows benchmark improvements of 3-5 points across knowledge, reasoning, and coding tasks, with Needle-in-a-Haystack accuracy jumping from 84.2% to 97%. The researchers demonstrated offloading a 100-billion-parameter embedding table to system DRAM with throughput penalties below 3%. Co-authored by founder Liang Wenfeng and Peking University researchers, the fully open-source paper and code suggest Engram will underpin DeepSeek's forthcoming V4 model. The Problem: GPU Memory as Scaling Bottleneck Modern Transformers suffer from a fundamental architectural inefficiency. When an LLM needs to recall a static fact\"Paris is the capital of France\" or \"Diana, Princess of Wales\"it cannot query a database [1]. Instead, the model simulates retrieval through expensive computation, consuming multiple layers of attention and feed-forward networks to reconstruct patterns that could be handled by simple lookup [1].

GPU high-bandwidth memory remains expensive and scarce [2]. The mere presence of larger, faster HBM does not yield sustained slackdevelopers immediately build larger models to fill it, ensuring memory remains the next bottleneck [3]. Engram Architecture: How It Works Engram introduces conditional memory as a complementary axis of sparsity, modernizing classic N-gram embeddings to perform constant-time O(1) lookups alongside the neural backbone [4]. Three Core Innovations Tokenizer Compression : Engram compresses equivalent tokens (different capitalizations of the same word) to canonical forms, reducing vocabulary size by 23% [5].

This paper begins by reviewing the evolution of large AI models focusing on paradigm shifts, the mainstream Large Language Model (LLM) paradigm, and the DeepSeek paradigm. Subsequently, the paper highlights novel algorithms introduced by DeepSeek, including Multi-head Latent Attention (MLA), Mixture-of-Experts (MoE), Multi-Token Prediction (MTP), and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). The paper then explores DeepSeek engineering breakthroughs in LLM scaling, training, inference, and system-level optimization architecture. Moreover, the impact of DeepSeek models on the competitive AI landscape is analyzed, comparing them to mainstream LLMs across various fields. Finally, the paper reflects on the insights gained from DeepSeek innovations and discusses future trends in the technical and engineering development of large AI models, particularly in data, training, and reasoning.

Frequently Asked Questions Quick Summary DeepSeek, in collaboration with Peking University, has released a 33-page paper introducing Engram a new sparse memory module that complements Mixture of Experts (MoE). While MoE solves \"how to calculate less,\" Engram solves \"don't calculate blindly\" by providing deterministic O(1) knowledge lookup for static patterns like entity names and fixed phrases. The paper discovers a Sparsity Allocation Law: 20-25% of sparse parameters should go to memory, with the rest to computation. The Problem: Transformer's Memory Limitation Currently, Mixture of Experts (MoE) has become the mainstream architecture for large language models, powering systems like DeepSeek V3, Mixtral, and others. However, it's fundamentally still based on the Transformer architecture, which lacks a native \"knowledge lookup\" mechanism. This means that many tasks that should be solved in O(1) time like retrieving factual information have to be \"simulated\" through extensive computations. The model essentially has to compute its way to remember things that could simply be looked up.

In theory, this process could be completed through a single knowledge lookup operation like looking up a word in a dictionary. The paper argues that this is fundamentally wasteful: using expensive compute cycles to repeatedly \"rediscover\" static knowledge that could be retrieved in constant time. Enter Engram: The \"Electronic Brain\" Module The term Engram originates from neurology, meaning \"memory trace\" an extensible and retrievable memory unit. DeepSeek's implementation modernizes the classic \"hashed N-gram embedding\" technique and transforms it into an extensibl",

Blake Crosley Jan 14, 2026 9 min read Disclaimer DeepSeek's Engram Separates Memory from Reasoning in LLM Architecture Breakthrough DeepSeek published research on January 12, 2026 introducing Engram, a conditional memory module that achieves constant-time knowledge retrieval by decoupling static pattern storage from dynamic reasoningpotentially bypassing the GPU high-bandwidth memory constraints that limit model scaling. TL;DR DeepSeek's Engram module introduces a new axis of sparsity for large language models, separating factual knowledge storage from computational reasoning. Testing on a 27-billion-parameter model shows benchmark improvements of 3-5 points across knowledge, reasoning, and coding tasks, with Needle-in-a-Haystack accuracy jumping from 84.2% to 97%. The researchers demonstrated offloading a 100-billion-parameter embedding table to system DRAM with throughput penalties below 3%. Co-authored by founder Liang Wenfeng and Peking University researchers, the fully open-source paper and code suggest Engram will underpin DeepSeek's forthcoming V4 model. The Problem: GPU Memory as Scaling Bottleneck Modern Transformers suffer from a fundamental architectural inefficiency. When an LLM needs to recall a static fact\"Paris is the capital of France\" or \"Diana, Princess of Wales\"it cannot query a database [1]. Instead, the model simulates retrieval through expensive computation, consuming multiple layers of attention and feed-forward networks to reconstruct patterns that could be handled by simple lookup [1]. Architecture Type Knowledge Handling GPU HBM Usage Standard Transformer All layers compute everything High Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Conditional computation High Engram + MoE Static lookup + dynamic reasoning Optimized This inefficiency compounds as models scale. GPU high-bandwidth memory remains expensive and scarce [2]. The mere presence of larger, faster HBM does not yield sustained slackdevelopers immediately build larger models to fill it, ensuring memory remains the next bottleneck [3]. Engram Architecture: How It Works Engram introduces conditional memory as a complementary axis of sparsity, modernizing classic N-gram embeddings to perform constant-time O(1) lookups alongside the neural backbone [4]. Three Core Innovations Tokenizer Compression : Engram compresses equivalent tokens (different capitalizations of the same word) to canonical forms, reducing vocabulary size by 23% [5]. The compression pipeline converts tokens through text normalization (NFKC NFD strip accents lowercase whitespace collapse) and maps all tokens normalizing to the same string to a single compressed ID [6]. Multi-Head Hashing : Storing a table for every possible N-gram combination is intractable. Engram employs K distinct hash heads for each N-gram order to mitigate collisions [7]. When retrieving embeddings, the system aggregates across all heads, reducing the impact of any single collision [8]. Context-Aware Gating : Retrieved embeddings pass through a gating mechanism where the model's current hidden state acts as a query [9]. If retrieved memory contradicts the broader context,",

Here's what makes it different Published Tue, Sep 30 2025 4:43 AM EDT Updated Tue, Sep 30 2025 5:16 AM EDT Tasmin Lockwood WATCH LIVE Key Points DeepSeek announced on Monday the release of an experimental version of its current model DeepSeek-V3.1-Terminus. Despite speculation of a bubble forming, AI remains at the centre of geopolitical competition with the U.S. and China vying for the winning spot. \"This is DeepSeek's value prop all over: efficiency is becoming as important as raw power,\" according to Nick Patience, VP and Practice Lead for AI at The Futurum Group. Anna Barclay | Getty Images News | Getty Images Chinese startup DeepSeek's latest experimental model promises to increase efficiency and improve AI's ability to handle a lot of information at a fraction of the cost, but questions remain over how effective and safe the architecture is. DeepSeek sent Silicon Valley into a frenzy when it launched its first model R1 out of nowhere last year, showing that it's possible to train large language models (LLMs) quickly, on less powerful chips, using fewer resources. The company released DeepSeek-V3.2-Exp on Monday, an experimental version of its current model DeepSeek-V3.1-Terminus, which builds further on its mission to increase efficiency in AI systems, according to a post on the AI forum Hugging Face . \"DeepSeek V3.2 continues the focus on efficiency, cost reduction, and open-source sharing,\" Adina Yakefu, Chinese community lead at Hugging Face, told CNBC. \"The big improvement is a new feature called DSA (DeepSeek Sparse Attention), which makes the AI better at handling long documents and conversations. It also cuts the cost of running the AI in half compared to the previous version.\" \"It's significant because it should make the model faster and more cost-effective to use without a noticeable drop in performance,\" said Nick Patience, vice president and practice lead for AI at The Futurum Group. \"This makes powerful AI more accessible to developers, researchers, and smaller companies, potentially leading to a wave of new and innovative applications.\" The pros and cons of sparse attention An AI model makes decisions based on its training data and new information, such as a prompt. Say an airline wants to find the best route from A to B, while there are many options, not all are feasible. By filtering out the less viable routes, you dramatically reduce the amount of time, fuel and, ultimately, money, needed to make the journey. That is exactly sparse attention does, it only factors in data that it thinks is important given the task",

Introduction The DeepSeek R1 model has undergone a minor version upgrade, with the current version being DeepSeek-R1-0528. In the latest update, DeepSeek R1 has significantly improved its depth of reasoning and inference capabilities by leveraging increased computational resources and introducing algorithmic optimization mechanisms during post-training. The model has demonstrated outstanding performance across various benchmark evaluations, including mathematics, programming, and general logic. Its overall performance is now approaching that of leading models, such as O3 and Gemini 2.5 Pro. Compared to the previous version, the upgraded model shows significant improvements in handling complex reasoning tasks. For instance, in the AIME 2025 test, the models accuracy has increased from 70% in the previous version to 87.5% in the current version. This advancement stems from enhanced thinking depth during the reasoning process: in the AIME test set, the previous model used an average of 12K tokens per question, whereas the new version averages 23K tokens per question. Beyond its improved reasoning capabilities, this version also offers a reduced hallucination rate, enhanced support for function calling, and better experience for vibe coding. 2. Evaluation Results DeepSeek-R1-0528 For all our models, the maximum generation length is set to 64K tokens. For benchmarks requiring sampling, we use a temperature of $0.6$, a top-p value of $0.95$, and generate 16 responses per query to estimate pass@1.

We only evaluate text-only prompts in HLE testsets. GPT-4.1 is employed to act user role in Tau-bench evaluation. DeepSeek-R1-0528-Qwen3-8B Meanwhile, we distilled the chain-of-thought from DeepSeek-R1-0528 to post-train Qwen3 8B Base, obtaining DeepSeek-R1-0528-Qwen3-8B. This model achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance among open-source models on the AIME 2024, surpassing Qwen3 8B by +10.0% and matching the performance of Qwen3-235B-thinking. We believe that the chain-of-thought from DeepSeek-R1-0528 will hold significant importance for both academic research on reasoning models and industrial development focused on small-scale models.

Here's what makes it different Published Tue, Sep 30 2025 4:43 AM EDT Updated Tue, Sep 30 2025 5:16 AM EDT Tasmin Lockwood WATCH LIVE Key Points DeepSeek announced on Monday the release of an experimental version of its current model DeepSeek-V3.1-Terminus. Despite speculation of a bubble forming, AI remains at the centre of geopolitical competition with the U.S. and China vying for the winning spot. \"This is DeepSeek's value prop all over: efficiency is becoming as important as raw power,\" according to Nick Patience, VP and Practice Lead for AI at The Futurum Group. Anna Barclay | Getty Images News | Getty Images Chinese startup DeepSeek's latest experimental model promises to increase efficiency and improve AI's ability to handle a lot of information at a fraction of the cost, but questions remain over how effective and safe the architecture is. DeepSeek sent Silicon Valley into a frenzy when it launched its first model R1 out of nowhere last year, showing that it's possible to train large language models (LLMs) quickly, on less powerful chips, using fewer resources. The company released DeepSeek-V3.2-Exp on Monday, an experimental version of its current model DeepSeek-V3.1-Terminus, which builds further on its mission to increase efficiency in AI systems, according to a post on the AI forum Hugging Face . \"DeepSeek V3.2 continues the focus on efficiency, cost reduction, and open-source sharing,\" Adina Yakefu, Chinese community lead at Hugging Face, told CNBC. \"The big improvement is a new feature called DSA (DeepSeek Sparse Attention), which makes the AI better at handling long documents and conversations. It also cuts the cost of running the AI in half compared to the previous version.\" \"It's significant because it should make the model faster and more cost-effective to use without a noticeable drop in performance,\" said Nick Patience, vice president and practice lead for AI at The Futurum Group. \"This makes powerful AI more accessible to developers, researchers, and smaller companies, potentially leading to a wave of new and innovative applications.\" The pros and cons of sparse attention An AI model makes decisions based on its training data and new information, such as a prompt. Say an airline wants to find the best route from A to B, while there are many options, not all are feasible. By filtering out the less viable routes, you dramatically reduce the amount of time, fuel and, ultimately, money, needed to make the journey. That is exactly sparse attention does, it only factors in data that it thinks is important given the task",

Introduction The DeepSeek R1 model has undergone a minor version upgrade, with the current version being DeepSeek-R1-0528. In the latest update, DeepSeek R1 has significantly improved its depth of reasoning and inference capabilities by leveraging increased computational resources and introducing algorithmic optimization mechanisms during post-training. The model has demonstrated outstanding performance across various benchmark evaluations, including mathematics, programming, and general logic. Its overall performance is now approaching that of leading models, such as O3 and Gemini 2.5 Pro. Compared to the previous version, the upgraded model shows significant improvements in handling complex reasoning tasks. For instance, in the AIME 2025 test, the models accuracy has increased from 70% in the previous version to 87.5% in the current version. This advancement stems from enhanced thinking depth during the reasoning process: in the AIME test set, the previous model used an average of 12K tokens per question, whereas the new version averages 23K tokens per question. Beyond its improved reasoning capabilities, this version also offers a reduced hallucination rate, enhanced support for function calling, and better experience for vibe coding. 2. Evaluation Results DeepSeek-R1-0528 For all our models, the maximum generation length is set to 64K tokens. For benchmarks requiring sampling, we use a temperature of $0.6$, a top-p value of $0.95$, and generate 16 responses per query to estimate pass@1.

We only evaluate text-only prompts in HLE testsets. GPT-4.1 is employed to act user role in Tau-bench evaluation. DeepSeek-R1-0528-Qwen3-8B Meanwhile, we distilled the chain-of-thought from DeepSeek-R1-0528 to post-train Qwen3 8B Base, obtaining DeepSeek-R1-0528-Qwen3-8B. This model achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance among open-source models on the AIME 2024, surpassing Qwen3 8B by +10.0% and matching the performance of Qwen3-235B-thinking. We believe that the chain-of-thought from DeepSeek-R1-0528 will hold significant importance for both academic research on reasoning models and industrial development focused on small-scale models.

Executive Summary\n\nDeepSeek AI, in collaboration with Peking University, has unveiled a significant architectural innovation with the **Engram module**, designed to address fundamental memory limitations inherent in Transformer-based LLMs. This novel conditional memory architecture promises O(1) knowledge lookup, decoupling static knowledge retrieval from intensive computation and freeing up LLM layers for more profound reasoning. This advancement is poised to be a cornerstone for future DeepSeek models, potentially powering the anticipated DeepSeek V4. Beyond Engram, DeepSeek continues its strong trajectory in developing specialized LLMs for code and mathematics, advancing multimodal capabilities, and refining Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures, all while maintaining a commitment to open-source contributions.\n\n## 2. Core Innovation: The Engram Module\n\nThe Engram module represents a paradigm shift in LLM architecture, directly tackling the inefficiencies of static knowledge retrieval within the Transformer framework. Unlike traditional LLMs that simulate knowledge lookup through computationally expensive multi-layer processing, Engram provides a deterministic, constant-time (O(1)) mechanism for accessing factual information. This is achieved by decoupling knowledge storage and retrieval from the core computational layers, thereby reducing compute waste and alleviating GPU memory bottlenecks.\n\n### 2.1. Problem Addressed: Transformer's Memory Limitation\n\nModern LLMs, including DeepSeek V3, predominantly utilize the Transformer architecture, which, despite its power, lacks a native mechanism for efficient knowledge lookup. Tasks that ideally require a simple dictionary-like retrieval, such as identifying a known entity or a common phrase, are instead processed through extensive computations across multiple layers. This is fundamentally wasteful, as it consumes valuable computational resources that could otherwise be dedicated to complex reasoning and problem-solving.\n\n### 2.2. Engram's Architecture and Functionality\n\nThe Engram module introduces a new axis of sparsity, augmenting existing LLM architectures. It acts as a complementary component, leveraging lessons from classical N-gram embeddings. The core of Engram's functionality lies in its ability to store static patterns—like named entities, fixed phrases, and formulas—in a dedicated embedding matrix. This matrix is learned during the training process. During inference, these patterns are retrieved using computationally inexpensive lookup operations.\n\nKey features of the Engram module include:\n\n*   **O(1) Knowledge Lookup**: Enables constant-time retrieval of static knowledge.\n*   **Conditional Memory**: Memory access is conditional, guided by the model's current state.\n*   **New Axis of Sparsity**: Introduces a distinct dimension of sparsity beyond computational sparsity.\n*   **Complementary to MoE**: Works in conjunction with Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures.\n*   **Tokenizer Compression**: Reduces vocabulary size by 23% by mapping equivalent tokens to canonical forms.\n*   **Multi-Head Hashing**: Employs multiple hash heads to mitigate collisions when storing N-grams.\n*   **Context-Aware Gating**: A gating mechanism uses the model's hidden state to query retrieved memory, ensuring contextual relevance.\n\n### 2.3. Benefits and Impact\n\nThe implementation of the Engram module offers a multitude of benefits:\n\n*   **Fixes Transformer's Memory Flaws**: Directly addresses the inefficiency of simulating knowledge retrieval through computation.\n*   **Reduces Compute Waste**: Minimizes unnecessary computational cycles spent on recalling static information.\n*   **Boosts Reasoning Capabilities**: Frees up LLM layers to focus on deeper, more complex reasoning tasks.\n*   **Enables LLM Scaling**: Helps overcome memory bottlenecks that limit the scalability of LLMs.\n*   **Reduces GPU Memory Bottleneck**: Optimizes memory usage, particularly crucial given the scarcity and cost of GPU High-Bandwidth Memory (HBM).\n*   **Improved Long-Context Accuracy**: Demonstrated potential for improved accuracy in handling long contexts, achieving 97% in specific tests.\n*   **Efficient Offloading**: Capable of offloading a significant number of parameters (e.g., 100 billion) to CPU/SSD with minimal (<3%) overhead.\n\nThe research paper associated with this innovation is titled \"Conditional Memory via Scalable Lookup: A New Axis of Sparsity for Large Language Models,\" and it was released on January 12, 2026. This development is a significant collaboration between DeepSeek AI and Peking University.\n\n## 3.

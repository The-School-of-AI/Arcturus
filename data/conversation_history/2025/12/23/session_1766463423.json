Data from monitoring centres shows that the average Air Quality Index has crossed 2020 levels, with overall air quality dropping by 22 per cent compared to last year. Grim comparison In February 2020, Bengalurus average AQI stood at 131. By December 27 this year, the average had climbed to 143, indicating a clear deterioration. On December 21, the city recorded an AQI of 175, placing it firmly in the unhealthy category. Experts point out that breathing Bengalurus air for a day is now equivalent to smoking nearly three cigarettes, underlining the health risk posed by prolonged exposure. Compared to previous years, 2025 has emerged as the most polluted year in the last five-year period. Seasonal spike Pollution levels began rising sharply after October this year. From December 5 onwards, the daily average AQI has consistently remained above 149. The city recorded a one-day average AQI of 166 on December 15, the second-highest daily average of the year. A similar spike was seen on November 28, when the AQI touched 167. Between October 1 and December 15, November 22 was the only day when the AQI dipped to a relatively low 52, falling under the good category, according to the data. Monthly pattern Month-wise data for 2025 shows worrying fluctuations. Out of 361 days in 2025 till December 27, Bengaluru enjoyed good air quality in only two days. Air quality was satisfactory on 253 days, moderate on 81 days and unhealthy on 24 days. Relief came briefly during the monsoon months, with July at 60, August at 57 and September at 63. However, pollution levels climbed again post-monsoon, with October at 83, November at 124 and December averaging 143 so far. Out of 361 days in 2025 till December 27, Bengaluru enjoyed good air quality in only two days. Air quality was satisfactory on 253 days, moderate on 81 days and unhealthy on 24 days. Monitoring data confirms that no other year in the last five years has recorded such consistently high pollution levels. For comparison, the citys average AQI stood at 86 in 2020, 84 in 2021, 87 in 2022, 78 in 2023 and 73 in 2024, before jumping sharply in 2025.

Data from monitoring centres shows that the average Air Quality Index has crossed 2020 levels, with overall air quality dropping by 22 per cent compared to last year. Grim comparison In February 2020, Bengalurus average AQI stood at 131. By December 27 this year, the average had climbed to 143, indicating a clear deterioration. On December 21, the city recorded an AQI of 175, placing it firmly in the unhealthy category. Experts point out that breathing Bengalurus air for a day is now equivalent to smoking nearly three cigarettes, underlining the health risk posed by prolonged exposure. Compared to previous years, 2025 has emerged as the most polluted year in the last five-year period. Seasonal spike Pollution levels began rising sharply after October this year. From December 5 onwards, the daily average AQI has consistently remained above 149. The city recorded a one-day average AQI of 166 on December 15, the second-highest daily average of the year.

Data from monitoring centres shows that the average Air Quality Index has crossed 2020 levels, with overall air quality dropping by 22 per cent compared to last year. Grim comparison In February 2020, Bengalurus average AQI stood at 131. By December 27 this year, the average had climbed to 143, indicating a clear deterioration. On December 21, the city recorded an AQI of 175, placing it firmly in the unhealthy category. Experts point out that breathing Bengalurus air for a day is now equivalent to smoking nearly three cigarettes, underlining the health risk posed by prolonged exposure. Compared to previous years, 2025 has emerged as the most polluted year in the last five-year period. Seasonal spike Pollution levels began rising sharply after October this year. From December 5 onwards, the daily average AQI has consistently remained above 149. The city recorded a one-day average AQI of 166 on December 15, the second-highest daily average of the year. A similar spike was seen on November 28, when the AQI touched 167. Between October 1 and December 15, November 22 was the only day when the AQI dipped to a relatively low 52, falling under the good category, according to the data. Monthly pattern Month-wise data for 2025 shows worrying fluctuations. Out of 361 days in 2025 till December 27, Bengaluru enjoyed good air quality in only two days. Air quality was satisfactory on 253 days, moderate on 81 days and unhealthy on 24 days. Relief came briefly during the monsoon months, with July at 60, August at 57 and September at 63. However, pollution levels climbed again post-monsoon, with October at 83, November at 124 and December averaging 143 so far. Out of 361 days in 2025 till December 27, Bengaluru enjoyed good air quality in only two days. Air quality was satisfactory on 253 days, moderate on 81 days and unhealthy on 24 days. Monitoring data confirms that no other year in the last five years has recorded such consistently high pollution levels. For comparison, the citys average AQI stood at 86 in 2020, 84 in 2021, 87 in 2022, 78 in 2023 and 73 in 2024, before jumping sharply in 2025.

Data from monitoring centres shows that the average Air Quality Index has crossed 2020 levels, with overall air quality dropping by 22 per cent compared to last year. Grim comparison In February 2020, Bengalurus average AQI stood at 131. By December 27 this year, the average had climbed to 143, indicating a clear deterioration. On December 21, the city recorded an AQI of 175, placing it firmly in the unhealthy category. Experts point out that breathing Bengalurus air for a day is now equivalent to smoking nearly three cigarettes, underlining the health risk posed by prolonged exposure. Compared to previous years, 2025 has emerged as the most polluted year in the last five-year period. Seasonal spike Pollution levels began rising sharply after October this year. From December 5 onwards, the daily average AQI has consistently remained above 149. The city recorded a one-day average AQI of 166 on December 15, the second-highest daily average of the year. A similar spike was seen on November 28, when the AQI touched 167. Between October 1 and December 15, November 22 was the only day when the AQI dipped to a relatively low 52, falling under the good category, according to the data. Monthly pattern Month-wise data for 2025 shows worrying fluctuations. Out of 361 days in 2025 till December 27, Bengaluru enjoyed good air quality in only two days. Air quality was satisfactory on 253 days, moderate on 81 days and unhealthy on 24 days. Relief came briefly during the monsoon months, with July at 60, August at 57 and September at 63. However, pollution levels climbed again post-monsoon, with October at 83, November at 124 and December averaging 143 so far. Out of 361 days in 2025 till December 27, Bengaluru enjoyed good air quality in only two days. Air quality was satisfactory on 253 days, moderate on 81 days and unhealthy on 24 days. Monitoring data confirms that no other year in the last five years has recorded such consistently high pollution levels. For comparison, the citys average AQI stood at 86 in 2020, 84 in 2021, 87 in 2022, 78 in 2023 and 73 in 2024, before jumping sharply in 2025.

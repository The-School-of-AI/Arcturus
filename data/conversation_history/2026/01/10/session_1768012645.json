The film, starring Brad Pitt and directed with a high-octane lens on the racing world, continues to draw audiences a month after its premiere, with total earnings now hovering around $509 million. Released on June 27, the film opened with an impressive $145 million weekend, outperforming industry expectations. Since then, it has grossed approximately $165 million in the U.S. and $344 million internationally. Despite a relatively average domestic showing, its performance abroad has more than compensated, helping it surpass all prior Apple Original Films in box office revenue. IMAX Re-Release and Continued Momentum With continued strong attendance, F1 is slated for an IMAX re-release in August, which could push its total well above $550 million. Industry forecasts place its final haul just shy of $600 million, a figure believed to be Apples break-even point when factoring in the films reported $200 million production budget and additional marketing and distribution costs. The success gives Apple a rare win in the theatrical space, delivering both cultural cachet and massive reach ahead of the films eventual release on Apple TV+, likely in October. With streaming as its primary focus, Apple has not committed to wide theatrical runs for its upcoming film slate. Still, F1 proves the model can work, especially for high-profile titles. Comparisons and Industry Context According to CNBC , both F1 and Warner Bros. Superman remake are projected to cross $500 million in global revenue by the end of July, with Superman expected to narrowly edge ahead with $502 million. Despite the close race, F1 s sustained run over four weeks is notable. The film has also far outpaced other Apple-backed releases. Ridley Scotts Napoleon brought in $221 million, while Martin Scorseses Killers of the Flower Moon reached $158 million in theatres. Both titles added income from secondary channels, but neither approached F1 s first-run numbers. As reported by industry tracker Comscore and cited by CNBC , F1 crossed $400 million by mid-July and hasnt slowed down since. That figure alone already made it the highest-grossing Apple Original in theaters. Apples investment in custom camera rigs to shoot real Formula One races added to the films authenticity. According to Apple, these specially designed cameras were critical to capturing the speed and detail needed to bring the sport to life on screen. Long-Term Impact and Streaming Prospects Apples Custom Cameras to Shoot F1. Credits: Apple While Apple has yet to formally announce when F1 will debut on its streaming platform, trade sources expect it to arrive on Apple TV+ before the end of the year . In the meantime, the film is likely to continue generating revenue through premium rentals, global TV licensing, and other post-theatrical distribution channels. The films impact is extending beyond cinema. Sources close to the company say Apple is considering acquiring live Formula One broadcasting rights for Apple TV+, a move likely influenced by the fan response to the film. By breaking into blockbuster territory with F1 , Apple has shown it can compe",

The film reached $509 million in ticket sales as of the final weekend in July, according to Comscore data reported by CNBC . F1 eclipses the previous record held by \"Napoleon,\" Ridley Scott's 2023 historical epic, which grossed $221 million worldwide. The film also significantly outperformed other Apple theatrical projects including \"Killers of the Flower Moon\" ($158 million), \"Argylle\" ($96 million), and \"Fly Me to the Moon\" ($42 million). F1's box office performance positions Apple to recoup its full investment through theatrical receipts alone. The film crossed the $400 million threshold in mid-July. F1 was released in over 80 countries and reportedly maintained strong attendance during weekday screenings. With $509 million in earnings, F1 surpasses \"Superman\" at $502 million to become one of the most popular films of the summer. After its theatrical run, F1: The Movie is expected to come to Apple TV+ later this year. Apple is also believed to have put in a winning bid to stream Formula 1 itself.

This figure beats even the most optimistic expectations ahead of release, which cost Apple about $250 million to make. The film hit buy or rent video on demand on Friday, but a streaming date on Apple TV+ has not yet been announced. In the film, Sonny Hayes (Brad Pitt) comes out of retirement to help mentor an up-and-coming driver (Damson Idris) in a back-marker F1 team, APX GP, who needs to get a win to stay funded. The movie shot during real F1 races through the 2023 and 2024 season, and features a series of incredible racing sequences throughout. F1 is now Brad Pitts highest-grossing film ever, albeit not accounting for inflation. Apple has called the movie the years most successful original feature, although you can debate whether a movie set in the world of F1 can be deemed an original creation. It also holds a strong 97% rating on Rotten Tomatoes, and a Certified Fresh critical reception. Apple is obviously hoping the strong reception will translate to a big splash on Apple TV+, when the movie streams on the service in the coming months. However, the company is still yet to announce another wide theatrical release original film, since its retrenchment from cinemas . As of right now, it is producing a handful of original films per year, but they are all destined as straight to streaming releases. Cinema operators are optimistic that the success of F1 will reset Apples approach to theatrical, as the industry continues to struggle.

While the film is nearing $300 million in global ticket sales, it still has a few more laps to go in order to be profitable for Apple. In this article AAPL Follow your favorite stocks CREATE FREE ACCOUNT Still from Apple's \"F1.\" Apple Lights out and away we go. \"F1: The Movie\" hasn't even reached the checkered flag of its theatrical run, but it's already Apple's best film release ever. The film, distributed by Warner Bros. Discovery , zoomed past $293 million at the global box office over the weekend. This outpaced Ridley Scott's \"Napoleon,\" which generated $221 million during its run in 2023, to become Apple's highest-grossing theatrical release. The tech company has only sent a handful of films to cinemas with wide releases since delving into the media business in recent years. \"Killers of the Flower Moon\" tallied $158 million worldwide, \"Fly Me to the Moon\" took in just $42 million and \"Argylle\" generated $96 million in ticket sales globally. \"'F1' is an extremely important movie for Apple and for the industry at large,\" said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst at Comscore. \"It's a perfect test case for how a streaming service can develop a film that's tailormade for the big screen while simultaneously promoting the film across the millions of small screens that their technological footprint puts directly in front of their subscribers.\" \"F1\" has benefited greatly from its partnership with IMAX . Before production, Apple and the film's top creatives reached out to not only secure the use of IMAX's camera technology, but also a three-week release in its theaters. In fact, the \"F1\" deal meant that Universal's \"Jurassic World Rebirth\" didn't get a domestic IMAX release and was only featured on IMAX screens in China. That film will also appear in IMAX screens in Japan next month. \"F1\" has generated $60 million of its total global haul from IMAX theaters, a little more than 20% of its total gross so far. Domestically, the film has generated $27.4 million in ticket sales through IMAX screenings, about 25% of the film's ticket sales in the U.S. and Canada.

The film, starring Brad Pitt and directed with a high-octane lens on the racing world, continues to draw audiences a month after its premiere, with total earnings now hovering around $509 million. Released on June 27, the film opened with an impressive $145 million weekend, outperforming industry expectations. Since then, it has grossed approximately $165 million in the U.S. and $344 million internationally. Despite a relatively average domestic showing, its performance abroad has more than compensated, helping it surpass all prior Apple Original Films in box office revenue. IMAX Re-Release and Continued Momentum With continued strong attendance, F1 is slated for an IMAX re-release in August, which could push its total well above $550 million. Industry forecasts place its final haul just shy of $600 million, a figure believed to be Apples break-even point when factoring in the films reported $200 million production budget and additional marketing and distribution costs. The success gives Apple a rare win in the theatrical space, delivering both cultural cachet and massive reach ahead of the films eventual release on Apple TV+, likely in October. With streaming as its primary focus, Apple has not committed to wide theatrical runs for its upcoming film slate. Still, F1 proves the model can work, especially for high-profile titles. Comparisons and Industry Context According to CNBC , both F1 and Warner Bros. Superman remake are projected to cross $500 million in global revenue by the end of July, with Superman expected to narrowly edge ahead with $502 million. Despite the close race, F1 s sustained run over four weeks is notable. The film has also far outpaced other Apple-backed releases. Ridley Scotts Napoleon brought in $221 million, while Martin Scorseses Killers of the Flower Moon reached $158 million in theatres. Both titles added income from secondary channels, but neither approached F1 s first-run numbers. As reported by industry tracker Comscore and cited by CNBC , F1 crossed $400 million by mid-July and hasnt slowed down since. That figure alone already made it the highest-grossing Apple Original in theaters. Apples investment in custom camera rigs to shoot real Formula One races added to the films authenticity. According to Apple, these specially designed cameras were critical to capturing the speed and detail needed to bring the sport to life on screen. Long-Term Impact and Streaming Prospects Apples Custom Cameras to Shoot F1. Credits: Apple While Apple has yet to formally announce when F1 will debut on its streaming platform, trade sources expect it to arrive on Apple TV+ before the end of the year . In the meantime, the film is likely to continue generating revenue through premium rentals, global TV licensing, and other post-theatrical distribution channels. The films impact is extending beyond cinema. Sources close to the company say Apple is considering acquiring live Formula One broadcasting rights for Apple TV+, a move likely influenced by the fan response to the film. By breaking into blockbuster territory with F1 , Apple has shown it can compe",

This figure beats even the most optimistic expectations ahead of release, which cost Apple about $250 million to make. The film hit buy or rent video on demand on Friday, but a streaming date on Apple TV+ has not yet been announced. In the film, Sonny Hayes (Brad Pitt) comes out of retirement to help mentor an up-and-coming driver (Damson Idris) in a back-marker F1 team, APX GP, who needs to get a win to stay funded. The movie shot during real F1 races through the 2023 and 2024 season, and features a series of incredible racing sequences throughout. F1 is now Brad Pitts highest-grossing film ever, albeit not accounting for inflation. Apple has called the movie the years most successful original feature, although you can debate whether a movie set in the world of F1 can be deemed an original creation. It also holds a strong 97% rating on Rotten Tomatoes, and a Certified Fresh critical reception. Apple is obviously hoping the strong reception will translate to a big splash on Apple TV+, when the movie streams on the service in the coming months. However, the company is still yet to announce another wide theatrical release original film, since its retrenchment from cinemas . As of right now, it is producing a handful of original films per year, but they are all destined as straight to streaming releases. Cinema operators are optimistic that the success of F1 will reset Apples approach to theatrical, as the industry continues to struggle.

While the film is nearing $300 million in global ticket sales, it still has a few more laps to go in order to be profitable for Apple. In this article AAPL Follow your favorite stocks CREATE FREE ACCOUNT Still from Apple's \"F1.\" Apple Lights out and away we go. \"F1: The Movie\" hasn't even reached the checkered flag of its theatrical run, but it's already Apple's best film release ever. The film, distributed by Warner Bros. Discovery , zoomed past $293 million at the global box office over the weekend. This outpaced Ridley Scott's \"Napoleon,\" which generated $221 million during its run in 2023, to become Apple's highest-grossing theatrical release. The tech company has only sent a handful of films to cinemas with wide releases since delving into the media business in recent years. \"Killers of the Flower Moon\" tallied $158 million worldwide, \"Fly Me to the Moon\" took in just $42 million and \"Argylle\" generated $96 million in ticket sales globally. \"'F1' is an extremely important movie for Apple and for the industry at large,\" said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst at Comscore. \"It's a perfect test case for how a streaming service can develop a film that's tailormade for the big screen while simultaneously promoting the film across the millions of small screens that their technological footprint puts directly in front of their subscribers.\" \"F1\" has benefited greatly from its partnership with IMAX . Before production, Apple and the film's top creatives reached out to not only secure the use of IMAX's camera technology, but also a three-week release in its theaters. In fact, the \"F1\" deal meant that Universal's \"Jurassic World Rebirth\" didn't get a domestic IMAX release and was only featured on IMAX screens in China. That film will also appear in IMAX screens in Japan next month. \"F1\" has generated $60 million of its total global haul from IMAX theaters, a little more than 20% of its total gross so far. Domestically, the film has generated $27.4 million in ticket sales through IMAX screenings, about 25% of the film's ticket sales in the U.S. and Canada.

The film, starring Brad Pitt and directed with a high-octane lens on the racing world, continues to draw audiences a month after its premiere, with total earnings now hovering around $509 million. Released on June 27, the film opened with an impressive $145 million weekend, outperforming industry expectations. Since then, it has grossed approximately $165 million in the U.S. and $344 million internationally. Despite a relatively average domestic showing, its performance abroad has more than compensated, helping it surpass all prior Apple Original Films in box office revenue. IMAX Re-Release and Continued Momentum With continued strong attendance, F1 is slated for an IMAX re-release in August, which could push its total well above $550 million. Industry forecasts place its final haul just shy of $600 million, a figure believed to be Apples break-even point when factoring in the films reported $200 million production budget and additional marketing and distribution costs. The success gives Apple a rare win in the theatrical space, delivering both cultural cachet and massive reach ahead of the films eventual release on Apple TV+, likely in October.

Comparisons and Industry Context According to CNBC , both F1 and Warner Bros. Superman remake are projected to cross $500 million in global revenue by the end of July, with Superman expected to narrowly edge ahead with $502 million. Despite the close race, F1 s sustained run over four weeks is notable. The film has also far outpaced other Apple-backed releases. Ridley Scotts Napoleon brought in $221 million, while Martin Scorseses Killers of the Flower Moon reached $158 million in theatres. Both titles added income from secondary channels, but neither approached F1 s first-run numbers. As reported by industry tracker Comscore and cited by CNBC , F1 crossed $400 million by mid-July and hasnt slowed down since. That figure alone already made it the highest-grossing Apple Original in theaters. Apples investment in custom camera rigs to shoot real Formula One races added to the films authenticity.

While the film is nearing $300 million in global ticket sales, it still has a few more laps to go in order to be profitable for Apple. In this article AAPL Follow your favorite stocks CREATE FREE ACCOUNT Still from Apple's \"F1.\" Apple Lights out and away we go. \"F1: The Movie\" hasn't even reached the checkered flag of its theatrical run, but it's already Apple's best film release ever. The film, distributed by Warner Bros. Discovery , zoomed past $293 million at the global box office over the weekend. This outpaced Ridley Scott's \"Napoleon,\" which generated $221 million during its run in 2023, to become Apple's highest-grossing theatrical release. The tech company has only sent a handful of films to cinemas with wide releases since delving into the media business in recent years. \"Killers of the Flower Moon\" tallied $158 million worldwide, \"Fly Me to the Moon\" took in just $42 million and \"Argylle\" generated $96 million in ticket sales globally. \"'F1' is an extremely important movie for Apple and for the industry at large,\" said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst at Comscore. \"It's a perfect test case for how a streaming service can develop a film that's tailormade for the big screen while simultaneously promoting the film across the millions of small screens that their technological footprint puts directly in front of their subscribers.\" \"F1\" has benefited greatly from its partnership with IMAX . Before production, Apple and the film's top creatives reached out to not only secure the use of IMAX's camera technology, but also a three-week release in its theaters. In fact, the \"F1\" deal meant that Universal's \"Jurassic World Rebirth\" didn't get a domestic IMAX release and was only featured on IMAX screens in China. That film will also appear in IMAX screens in Japan next month. \"F1\" has generated $60 million of its total global haul from IMAX theaters, a little more than 20% of its total gross so far. Domestically, the film has generated $27.4 million in ticket sales through IMAX screenings, about 25% of the film's ticket sales in the U.S. and Canada.

The film reached $509 million in ticket sales as of the final weekend in July, according to Comscore data reported by CNBC . F1 eclipses the previous record held by \"Napoleon,\" Ridley Scott's 2023 historical epic, which grossed $221 million worldwide. The film also significantly outperformed other Apple theatrical projects including \"Killers of the Flower Moon\" ($158 million), \"Argylle\" ($96 million), and \"Fly Me to the Moon\" ($42 million). F1's box office performance positions Apple to recoup its full investment through theatrical receipts alone. The film crossed the $400 million threshold in mid-July. F1 was released in over 80 countries and reportedly maintained strong attendance during weekday screenings. With $509 million in earnings, F1 surpasses \"Superman\" at $502 million to become one of the most popular films of the summer. After its theatrical run, F1: The Movie is expected to come to Apple TV+ later this year. Apple is also believed to have put in a winning bid to stream Formula 1 itself.

While the film is nearing $300 million in global ticket sales, it still has a few more laps to go in order to be profitable for Apple. In this article AAPL Follow your favorite stocks CREATE FREE ACCOUNT Still from Apple's \"F1.\" Apple Lights out and away we go. \"F1: The Movie\" hasn't even reached the checkered flag of its theatrical run, but it's already Apple's best film release ever. The film, distributed by Warner Bros. Discovery , zoomed past $293 million at the global box office over the weekend. This outpaced Ridley Scott's \"Napoleon,\" which generated $221 million during its run in 2023, to become Apple's highest-grossing theatrical release. The tech company has only sent a handful of films to cinemas with wide releases since delving into the media business in recent years. \"Killers of the Flower Moon\" tallied $158 million worldwide, \"Fly Me to the Moon\" took in just $42 million and \"Argylle\" generated $96 million in ticket sales globally. \"'F1' is an extremely important movie for Apple and for the industry at large,\" said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst at Comscore. \"It's a perfect test case for how a streaming service can develop a film that's tailormade for the big screen while simultaneously promoting the film across the millions of small screens that their technological footprint puts directly in front of their subscribers.\" \"F1\" has benefited greatly from its partnership with IMAX . Before production, Apple and the film's top creatives reached out to not only secure the use of IMAX's camera technology, but also a three-week release in its theaters. In fact, the \"F1\" deal meant that Universal's \"Jurassic World Rebirth\" didn't get a domestic IMAX release and was only featured on IMAX screens in China. That film will also appear in IMAX screens in Japan next month. \"F1\" has generated $60 million of its total global haul from IMAX theaters, a little more than 20% of its total gross so far. Domestically, the film has generated $27.4 million in ticket sales through IMAX screenings, about 25% of the film's ticket sales in the U.S. and Canada.
